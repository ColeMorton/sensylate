## Short-Form Templates

### Template A: Valuation Disconnect
```
üéØ $[TICKER] trading at $[PRICE] but our analysis shows fair value of $[RANGE]

The math is simple:
‚Ä¢ [Method 1]: $[VALUE] ([confidence]% confidence)
‚Ä¢ [Method 2]: $[VALUE] ([confidence]% confidence)
‚Ä¢ [Method 3]: $[VALUE] ([confidence]% confidence)

Weighted fair value: $[FINAL]

Key assumption: [CRITICAL DRIVER]

[BULL/BEAR] case target: $[TARGET] ([probability]% chance)

#[TICKER] #StockAnalysis #Valuation
```

### Template B: Catalyst Catalyst
```
üìà $[TICKER] has 3 major catalysts brewing:

1. [CATALYST 1] - [probability]% likely = +$[IMPACT]/share
2. [CATALYST 2] - [probability]% likely = +$[IMPACT]/share
3. [CATALYST 3] - [probability]% likely = +$[IMPACT]/share

Current price: $[PRICE]
Expected value if all hit: $[TOTAL]

The kicker: [TIMELINE DETAIL]

Risk: [TOP RISK FACTOR]

#[TICKER] #Catalysts #StockAnalysis
```

### Template C: Moat Analysis
```
üè∞ $[TICKER]'s competitive moat is [STRENGTHENING/WEAKENING]:

Strong advantages:
‚Ä¢ [MOAT 1]: [STRENGTH]/10 durability
‚Ä¢ [MOAT 2]: [STRENGTH]/10 durability
‚Ä¢ [MOAT 3]: [STRENGTH]/10 durability

Evidence: [SPECIFIC METRIC/TREND]

Threat level: [ASSESSMENT]

```
üîç Everyone's wrong about $[TICKER]. Here's what they're missing:

Market thinks: [COMMON PERCEPTION]
Reality: [CONTRARIAN INSIGHT]

Proof:
‚Ä¢ [DATA POINT 1]
‚Ä¢ [DATA POINT 2]
‚Ä¢ [DATA POINT 3]

This misconception = [X]% mispricing

Fair value: $[VALUE] vs $[CURRENT] current

Timeline for correction: [EXPECTATION]

## Content Optimization Guidelines

### Engagement Mechanics
1. **Lead with Numbers**: Specific percentages, dollar amounts, ratios
2. **Use Emojis Strategically**: 1-2 relevant emojis max for visual appeal
3. **Create Curiosity Gaps**: Tease insights before revealing
4. **Include Contrarian Elements**: Challenge conventional wisdom
5. **End with Clear Stakes**: What happens if thesis plays out

### Writing Style Requirements
- **Plain Language**: No jargon without explanation
- **Active Voice**: "Tesla dominates" not "Tesla is dominated by"
- **Specific Claims**: "$45/share impact" not "significant impact"
- **Present Tense**: Create immediacy and urgency
- **Confident Tone**: Back analysis with conviction scores

### Character Count Optimization
- **Target Length**: 280 characters per tweet (can thread if needed)
- **Tweet 1**: Hook + core insight
- **Tweet 2** (if needed): Supporting data
- **Tweet 3** (if needed): Risk/timeline/action

- [ ] **Balanced View**: Both upside and downside considerations

### Output Verification
