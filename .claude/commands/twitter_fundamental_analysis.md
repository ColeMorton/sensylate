## Content Optimization Guidelines

### Engagement Mechanics
1. **Lead with Numbers**: Specific percentages, dollar amounts, ratios
2. **Use Emojis Strategically**: 1-2 relevant emojis max for visual appeal
3. **Create Curiosity Gaps**: Tease insights before revealing
4. **Include Contrarian Elements**: Challenge conventional wisdom
5. **End with Clear Stakes**: What happens if thesis plays out

### Writing Style Requirements
- **Plain Language**: No jargon without explanation
- **Active Voice**: "Tesla dominates" not "Tesla is dominated by"
- **Specific Claims**: "$45/share impact" not "significant impact"
- **Present Tense**: Create immediacy and urgency
- **Confident Tone**: Back analysis with conviction scores

### Character Count Optimization
- **Target Length**: 280 characters per tweet (can thread if needed)
- **Tweet 1**: Hook + core insight
- **Tweet 2** (if needed): Supporting data
- **Tweet 3** (if needed): Risk/timeline/action
