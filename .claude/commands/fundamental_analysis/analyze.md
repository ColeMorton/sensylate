   → If found: Apply validation-driven enhancements targeting 9.5+ scores
   → If not found: Proceed with institutional-quality baseline analysis

5. **MANDATORY Discovery Data Preservation Protocol**
   → **CRITICAL: Preserve ALL discovery data in analysis output**
   → Load complete discovery sections: market_data, company_overview, economic_context
   → Preserve CLI service validation status and health scores
   → Maintain peer group data and comparative metrics
   → Ensure current price and economic indicators are inherited
   → FAIL-FAST if any critical discovery data is missing or incomplete
```

**0.2 Pre-Validated Data Integration**
```
PRE-VALIDATED METRICS INTEGRATION PROCESS:
Step 1: Financial Intelligence Extraction
   → Extract pre-calculated financial ratios with confidence scores
   → Load business model intelligence and revenue stream analysis
   → Integrate key business-specific KPIs and operational metrics
   → Map peer group data and comparative intelligence

Step 2: CLI Service Health Integration
   → Monitor CLI service operational status during analysis
   → Leverage data quality scores for confidence adjustments
   → Use service reliability metrics for risk assessment
   → Enable real-time validation capabilities

Step 3: Economic Context Mapping
   → Map restrictive monetary policy to sector implications
   → Integrate yield curve signals and policy implications
   → Apply interest rate sensitivity to growth and risk analysis
   → Use cryptocurrency sentiment for broader market context

Step 4: Confidence Score Propagation
   → Inherit high-confidence scores from discovery validation
   → Apply CLI service reliability to analytical confidence
   → Maintain institutional-grade quality standards (9.0+ baseline)
   → Target enhanced analysis scores of 9.5+ through CLI integration

Step 5: **Complete Discovery Data Inheritance Validation**
   → **MANDATORY: Verify ALL discovery sections are preserved**
   → Validate current price data integrity (CLI-validated price consistency)
   → Confirm economic context preservation (FRED/CoinGecko data)
   → Ensure CLI service health status is maintained
   → Preserve company overview and peer group intelligence
   → CRITICAL: Analysis must contain discovery data PLUS analysis additions

## Analysis Execution Protocol

### Pre-Execution
1. **Phase 0A Validation Check** (if validation_enhancement enabled)
   - Check for existing validation file: {TICKER}_{YYYYMMDD}_validation.json
   - If found, execute Phase 0A Enhancement Protocol for analysis optimization
   - If not found, proceed with standard analysis workflow
2. **MANDATORY Discovery Data Inheritance Validation**
   - **CRITICAL: Load ALL discovery data sections for preservation**
   - Validate current price data integrity (CLI-validated price consistency)
   - Confirm market data completeness (market cap, volume, beta, 52-week range)
   - Preserve company overview information (name, sector, CEO, headquarters)
   - Maintain economic context (Fed rates, yield curve, crypto sentiment)
   - Ensure CLI service health status is inherited
   - Preserve peer group analysis and comparative metrics
   - **FAIL-FAST if any critical discovery data is missing**
3. **Validate cash position data uses total liquid assets (not just cash equivalents)**
4. **Cross-validate financial data consistency** - verify all figures match discovery phase exactly
5. **Investment portfolio validation** - confirm clear distinction between total portfolio vs liquid assets
6. **Critical Calculation Verification**: Re-calculate all margins and ratios from raw financial data
7. **Precision Standards**: Use exact figures from income statements, no approximations
8. Initialize analytical frameworks and confidence thresholds (9.5+ target if validation enhancement active)
9. Load peer group data and industry benchmarks
10. Set up quality gates for analytical conclusions

### Main Execution
1. **Financial Health Analysis**
