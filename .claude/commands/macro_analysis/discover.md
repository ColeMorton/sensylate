# Macro-Economic Analyst Discover

**DASV Phase 1: Macro-Economic Data Collection and Context Gathering**

Comprehensive macro-economic data collection and market intelligence gathering for institutional-quality macro-economic analysis using systematic discovery protocols and researcher sub-agent orchestration focusing on business cycles, monetary policy, economic indicators, and market regime analysis.

## Purpose

The Macro-Economic Analysis Discovery phase defines the requirements for systematic collection and initial structuring of all data required for comprehensive macro-economic analysis. This specification focuses on **what** economic indicators and macroeconomic context is needed rather than **how** to obtain it, delegating technical implementation to the researcher sub-agent.

**Expected Output Schema**: `/{SCRIPTS_BASE}/schemas/macro_analysis_discovery_schema.json`
**Researcher Sub Task**: Use the researcher sub-agent to execute macro-economic analysis discovery. Ensure output conforms to `/{SCRIPTS_BASE}/schemas/macro_analysis_discovery_schema.json`.
