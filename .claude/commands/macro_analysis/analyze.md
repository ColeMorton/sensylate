## Quality Standards

### Template Gap Coverage
- All template requirements not in discovery must be addressed
- Business cycle and liquidity cycle analysis completed
- Industry scorecard with A-F grades generated
- Multi-method valuation framework implemented
- Quantified risk assessment with probability/impact matrices

### Analytical Rigor
- All conclusions must have confidence scores ≥ confidence_threshold
- Quantitative support for all grading and scoring decisions
- Clear methodology documentation for calculations
- Evidence backing for all probability and impact assignments

### Discovery Data Integration
- Reference discovery data without duplication
- Build upon existing economic context and sector intelligence
- Inherit and propagate discovery confidence scores
- Maintain data continuity for synthesis phase

### Synthesis Phase Readiness
- Output structure compatible with template generation
- All template gaps filled with institutional-quality analysis
