- **Tool Integration**: Python script orchestration with quality assurance
- **Data-Driven Methodology**: Elimination of hardcoded assumptions
- **Cross-Asset Integration**: Regional correlation and transmission analysis
- **Policy Response Assessment**: Regional capacity and coordination evaluation

**Domain Focus**: This specification emphasizes regional economic requirements and unique macro-economic factors while delegating universal analytical methodology to the analyst sub-agent for consistent institutional-grade execution.
