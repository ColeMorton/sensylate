```python
def validate_confidence_threshold(confidence: float, phase: str) -> None:
    """Enforce institutional quality standards with fail-fast approach"""
    minimum_threshold = 0.90
    if confidence < minimum_threshold:
        raise QualityThresholdException(
            f"{phase} phase confidence {confidence:.3f} below institutional "
            f"threshold {minimum_threshold:.3f}"
        )
```

**Quality Enforcement Mechanisms**:
1. Data completeness: Minimum 85% field population
