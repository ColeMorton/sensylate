**Fail-Fast Implementation**:
```python
def validate_confidence_threshold(confidence: float, phase: str) -> None:
    """Enforce institutional quality standards with fail-fast approach"""
    minimum_threshold = 0.90
    if confidence < minimum_threshold:
        raise QualityThresholdException(
            f"{phase} phase confidence {confidence:.3f} below institutional "
            f"threshold {minimum_threshold:.3f}"
        )
```

**Quality Enforcement Mechanisms**:
1. Data completeness: Minimum 85% field population
2. Multi-source validation: Cross-validation across 3+ sources

- Price validation inconsistency → Check variance threshold (<2%)
- Data completeness gaps → Ensure >85% field population
- Schema validation failures → Verify required framework sections

**Analysis Phase Issues**:
- Data inheritance failures → Validate discovery data preservation
- Confidence threshold violations → Review statistical methodology
- Risk assessment gaps → Implement quantified risk framework
- Economic context missing → Include standardized indicators

**Synthesis Phase Issues**:
- Template compliance failures → Check institutional formatting
- Content customization gaps → Remove generic placeholders
- Evidence integration missing → Link to analysis foundation
- Quality threshold violations → Review narrative coherence

**Validation Phase Issues**:
- Assessment incompleteness → Ensure phase-by-phase evaluation
- Critical findings unaddressed → Prioritize high/critical issues
- Compliance verification gaps → Check framework adherence
- Enhancement recommendations missing → Provide systematic guidance

### Systematic Diagnosis Approach
