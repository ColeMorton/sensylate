## Microservice Integration

**Framework**: DASV Phase 2 - Analysis Phase
**Framework Coordinator**: dasv-analysis-agent (handles universal components where applicable)
**Role**: trade_history (domain-specific statistical specialist) 
**Action**: analyze
**Output Location**: `./data/outputs/trade_history/analysis/`
**Previous Phase**: trade_history_discover
**Next Phase**: trade_history_synthesize
**Framework Adaptation**: Trading-specific framework integration with statistical focus
**Quality Standards**: Institutional-grade framework compliance adapted for trading analysis

## Parameters

- `discovery_data`: Discovery phase output (required)
- `analysis_depth`: Analysis detail level - `summary` | `standard` | `comprehensive` | `deep-dive` (optional, default: comprehensive)
- `confidence_threshold`: Minimum confidence for calculations - `0.6` | `0.7` | `0.8` (optional, default: 0.7)
- `benchmark_focus`: Primary benchmark for analysis - `SPY` | `QQQ` | `VTI` (optional, default: from discovery)
- `statistical_rigor`: Statistical testing level - `basic` | `standard` | `institutional` (optional, default: standard)

## CRITICAL METHODOLOGY REQUIREMENTS

**⚠️ MANDATORY DATA HANDLING RULES** (For comprehensive analysis with proper separation):

1. **COMPREHENSIVE DATA INCLUSION RULE**: ALL trades MUST be included in analysis with proper categorization
   - Include both closed AND active trades for complete portfolio understanding
   - Clearly separate and isolate closed trades from active trades in all calculations
   - Group trades by status: Closed, Active (Open), with distinct analytical treatment
   - Performance calculations use ONLY closed trades, while portfolio analysis includes all trades

2. **CLOSED TRADES PERFORMANCE CALCULATION**:
   - ALL performance metrics (win rate, returns, statistics) calculated using ONLY closed trades
   - Never include open trades in realized performance calculations
   - Cross-validate all performance calculations against raw CSV closed trades only
   - Maintain separate performance section for closed trades analysis

3. **ACTIVE TRADES PORTFOLIO ANALYSIS**:
   - Analyze active trades for portfolio composition and risk assessment
   - Calculate unrealized performance metrics for active positions
   - Assess portfolio exposure, concentration, and open position characteristics
   - Provide comprehensive active position analysis for synthesis phase

4. **STRATEGY SAMPLE SIZE VALIDATION**:
   - Minimum 5 closed trades required for basic strategy performance analysis
   - Minimum 15 closed trades for statistical significance claims
   - If strategy has insufficient closed trades, exclude from performance analysis with clear status
   - Apply confidence penalties for small samples in performance calculations

5. **CONSERVATIVE CONFIDENCE SCORING**:
   - Base performance confidence on actual closed sample sizes, not total trade counts
   - Apply sample size penalties: confidence = min(0.8, 0.5 + (closed_trades / 30))
   - Never claim statistical significance without adequate closed sample
   - Include honest limitations in analysis output

6. **PHANTOM DATA PREVENTION**:
   - Before reporting strategy performance, verify closed trades > 0
   - Include data validation checks in pre-analysis phase
   - Flag impossible calculations (e.g., win rate with 0 closed trades)
   - Maintain clear separation between realized and unrealized analytics

## Framework Integration Approach

### Trading Analysis Framework Coordination

**Framework Note**: While the dasv-analysis-agent provides universal framework components, trading performance analysis requires specialized statistical frameworks. This integration adapts framework principles to trading-specific requirements while maintaining quality standards.

**Adapted Framework Integration**:
1. **Framework Foundation**: Utilize dasv-analysis-agent for metadata, quality tracking, and output structure
2. **Domain Specialization**: Maintain trading-specific statistical analysis and performance measurement
3. **Quality Standards**: Apply institutional-grade confidence thresholds adapted for statistical significance
4. **Output Coordination**: Generate framework-compatible output structure with trading-specific extensions

## DASV Analysis Phase Execution Protocol (Framework-Coordinated)

### Framework Integration Approach

**Execution Coordination**: This protocol adapts the **dasv-analysis-agent** framework for trading performance analysis while maintaining statistical analysis expertise.

**Adapted 10-Step DASV Analysis Process**:
1. **Initialize Framework Structure** (dasv-analysis-agent)
2. **Populate Universal Metadata** (dasv-analysis-agent)
3. **Validate Discovery Data Inheritance** (dasv-analysis-agent)
4. **Integrate Market Context** (adapted economic context for trading)
5. **Perform Domain-Specific Analysis** (trading_performance_analyst)
6. **Apply Risk Assessment Framework** (adapted for trading risks)
7. **Generate Analytical Insights** (trading-specific findings)
8. **Calculate Quality Metrics** (adapted confidence scoring for statistical analysis)
9. **Validate Against Schema** (framework compliance with trading adaptations)
10. **Export JSON Output** (framework-coordinated output structure)

### Pre-Execution (Framework-Coordinated)

**Agent Invocation**:
```
INVOKE dasv-analysis-agent WITH:
- discovery_file: trading_discovery_data.json
- analysis_type: trade_history
- confidence_threshold: 0.8 (adapted for statistical significance)
- framework_phase: initialize
- adaptation: trading_performance_analysis
```

**Framework Validation** (Steps 1-4):
1. **Initialize Framework Structure**: dasv-analysis-agent sets up adapted JSON architecture for trading
2. **Populate Universal Metadata**: Framework execution context with trading-specific metadata
3. **Validate Discovery Data Inheritance**: Trading data preservation verification with fail-fast
4. **Integrate Market Context**: Market regime and volatility context relevant to trading performance

**Domain Preparation**:
- Load trading-specific parameters and statistical thresholds
- Initialize calculation engines and validation systems
- Prepare statistical significance requirements
- Set up trading-specific quality gates

### Main Execution (Domain-Specific Analysis - Step 5)

**Trading Performance Analysis Domain Expertise**:
1. **Signal Effectiveness Analysis**
   - Execute comprehensive signal quality metrics and timing analysis
   - Analyze entry and exit signal performance with statistical validation
   - Calculate pure signal returns and benchmark comparisons
   - Generate signal timing effectiveness measurements

2. **Statistical Performance Measurement**
   - Perform quantitative performance evaluation with institutional rigor
   - Execute return distribution analysis and normality testing
   - Calculate expectancy, Sharpe ratios, and benchmark comparisons
   - Generate effectiveness measurement and trade quality classification

3. **Pattern Recognition and Quality Classification**
   - Conduct advanced pattern recognition and predictive characteristics identification
   - Analyze strategy-specific effectiveness and market condition sensitivity
   - Generate signal temporal patterns and optimization identification
   - Perform quality classification with statistical support

4. **Risk Assessment and Optimization**
   - Execute portfolio risk metrics and correlation analysis
   - Integrate market context and volatility impact analysis
   - Generate optimization opportunities and enhancement recommendations
   - Perform comprehensive statistical validation

**Framework Integration Points**:
- Risk assessment coordinated with framework (Step 6)
- Market context provided by adapted framework coordination
- Quality metrics calculated using adapted confidence scoring for statistical analysis

### Post-Execution (Framework-Coordinated - Steps 6-10)

**Agent Coordination**:
```
INVOKE dasv-analysis-agent WITH:
- domain_analysis: trading_analysis_results
- framework_phase: finalize
- output_template: base_analysis_template.j2 (adapted for trading)
- adaptation: trading_performance_output
```

**Framework Completion** (Steps 6-10):
6. **Apply Risk Assessment Framework**: Generate trading-specific risk matrices with portfolio focus
7. **Generate Analytical Insights**: Structured trading findings and performance implications
8. **Calculate Quality Metrics**: Adapted confidence scoring for statistical analysis and trading insights
9. **Validate Against Schema**: Framework compliance verification with trading-specific adaptations
10. **Export JSON Output**: File generation with framework structure adapted for trading analysis

**Final Validation**:
- Verify statistical significance thresholds (adapted from >90% to statistical significance levels)
- Confirm framework schema compliance with trading adaptations
- Validate synthesis phase readiness for trading reports
- Log performance metrics and statistical quality scores

### Framework-Coordinated Quality Standards

### Institutional-Grade Framework Standards (Adapted for Trading Analysis)
- **Statistical Significance Threshold**: p-value <0.05 for key findings (adapted from >90% confidence)
- **Sample Size Adequacy**: Minimum sample requirements with confidence penalties
- **Data Quality**: Trading data integrity and calculation accuracy validation
- **Framework Compliance**: Schema validation adapted for trading-specific requirements

### Domain-Specific Quality Requirements (Trading Performance Analysis)
- **Mandatory Methodology Compliance**:
  - CRITICAL: Verify all performance calculations use closed trades only
  - CRITICAL: Confirm no open trades included in win rates or returns  
  - CRITICAL: Validate strategy exclusion for insufficient samples
  - CRITICAL: Check confidence scoring reflects actual sample limitations

- **Statistical Accuracy Requirements**:
  - All calculations cross-validated against raw CSV closed trades
  - Confidence intervals properly calculated and within expected ranges
  - Sample size adequacy verified for statistical significance
  - Pattern recognition reliability validated against historical patterns

### Framework Validation Requirements (Enforced by dasv-analysis-agent)
- **Required Field Presence**: All universal framework sections adapted for trading analysis
- **Data Type Conformance**: Statistical significance p-values, confidence scores 0.0-1.0
- **Trading-Specific Constraints**: Sample size minimums, statistical thresholds
- **File Organization**: Correct naming `{portfolio}_{YYYYMMDD}_analysis.json`

### Fail-Fast Quality Enforcement (Framework-Managed with Trading Adaptations)
- Trading data integrity violations trigger immediate failure
- Sample size inadequacy below statistical thresholds triggers immediate failure
- Calculation inconsistencies trigger immediate failure with specific details
- Framework schema violations trigger immediate failure

### Integration Requirements (Framework-Coordinated with Trading Focus)
- **Template Utilization**: Uses base_analysis_template.j2 adapted for trading analysis
- **Adapted Macro Integration**: Leverages framework macros where applicable to trading context
- **Quality Propagation**: Statistical significance feeds into framework confidence scoring
- **Synthesis Readiness**: Trading-specific output compatible with synthesis phase requirements
