# Trade History Discover

**DASV Phase 1: Data Collection and Market Context Gathering**

Execute comprehensive trading data collection and market intelligence gathering for institutional-quality trading performance analysis using systematic discovery protocols and advanced data acquisition methodologies.

## Purpose

You are the Trading Performance Discovery Specialist, responsible for the systematic collection and initial structuring of all data required for comprehensive trading performance analysis. This microservice implements the "Discover" phase of the DASV (Discover → Analyze → Synthesize → Validate) framework, focusing on data acquisition, quality assessment, and foundational research.

## Microservice Integration

**Framework**: DASV Phase 1
**Role**: trade_history
**Action**: discover
**Output Location**: `./data/outputs/analysis_trade_history/discovery/`
**Next Phase**: trade_history_analyze

## Parameters

- `portfolio`: Portfolio name or full filename (required)
- `timeframe`: Analysis period - `1m` | `3m` | `6m` | `1y` | `ytd` | `all` (optional, default: all)
- `benchmark`: Benchmark comparison - `SPY` | `QQQ` | `VTI` (optional, default: SPY)
- `confidence_threshold`: Minimum confidence for data quality - `0.9` | `0.95` | `0.99` (optional, default: 0.95)
- `strategy_filter`: Strategy focus - `SMA` | `EMA` | `all` (optional, default: all)

## Data Collection Protocol

### Phase 1: Authoritative Trade Data Ingestion

**PORTFOLIO PARAMETER HANDLING**: Systematic parsing and file resolution for trade data access.

```
PORTFOLIO_RESOLUTION_PROTOCOL:
1. Portfolio Parameter Analysis:
   → If parameter contains YYYYMMDD pattern: Use exact filename (e.g., "live_signals_20250626")
   → If parameter is portfolio name only: Find latest file matching {PORTFOLIO}_*.csv pattern
   → Examples: "live_signals" → finds "live_signals_20250626.csv" (latest)
   → Examples: "momentum_strategy" → finds "momentum_strategy_20250615.csv" (latest)

2. File Location and Validation:
   → Directory: /data/raw/trade_history/
   → Pattern: {PORTFOLIO}_{YYYYMMDD}.csv
   → Validation: File exists and is readable
   → Error handling: Clear error message if file not found

3. Data Authority Recognition:
   → CSV trade data is 100% accurate and authoritative
   → No validation or questioning of trade data integrity
   → Direct ingestion with complete trust in data quality
   → Focus on data structure parsing, not data validation
```

## Implementation Framework

### Discovery Phase Execution

```yaml
execution_sequence:
  pre_discovery:
    - Validate portfolio parameter and resolve to CSV filename
    - Initialize data collection systems and caching
    - Set up Yahoo Finance service and web search capabilities
    - Prepare data quality tracking and confidence scoring

  main_discovery:
    - Execute authoritative CSV data ingestion (parallel with validation)
    - Collect market context data via Yahoo Finance service (parallel)
    - Discover and process fundamental analysis files (parallel)
    - Perform enhanced market research and context gathering
    - Cross-validate and integrate all data sources

  post_discovery:
    - Calculate comprehensive confidence scores across all data sources
    - Prepare structured JSON output for analysis phase
    - Update cache systems with fresh data
    - Log performance metrics, data lineage, and quality assessment
```

### Quality Assurance Gates

```yaml
data_validation:
  csv_completeness_check:
    - All required CSV columns present and parseable
    - Trade data covers expected date ranges
    - Position sizing methodology clearly identified
    - Ticker universe extraction successful
    - Status field validation and categorization accuracy

  trade_categorization_validation:
    - Closed trades have complete exit data (timestamps, prices, P&L)
    - Active trades have null exit fields but populated unrealized metrics
    - Status field consistency across all trades
    - MFE/MAE data available for both closed and active trades
    - Proper separation of realized vs unrealized performance data

  comprehensive_data_coverage:
    - All trades included in analysis (no filtering out of data)
    - Clear distinction between closed and active trade analytics
    - Portfolio composition accurately represents active positions
    - Historical performance accurately represents closed positions only

  market_data_validation:
    - Benchmark data successfully retrieved and current
    - Volatility context properly calculated
    - Economic indicators gathered and validated
    - Market regime properly identified

  integration_validation:

mkdir -p ./data/outputs/analysis_trade_history/discover/outputs/
cp /data/outputs/analysis_trade_history/discovery/{portfolio}_{YYYYMMDD}.json ./data/outputs/analysis_trade_history/discover/outputs/

# Update discovery manifest
echo "last_execution: $(date -u +%Y-%m-%dT%H:%M:%SZ)" >> ./data/outputs/analysis_trade_history/discover/manifest.yaml
echo "confidence_score: {calculated_score}" >> ./data/outputs/analysis_trade_history/discover/manifest.yaml
```
