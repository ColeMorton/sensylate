## Phase 1: Data Extraction & Template Population

### Multi-Source Analysis Protocol

**Step 1: PRIMARY - TrendSpider Tabular Analysis** (`@data/images/trendspider_tabular/{TICKER}_{YYYYMMDD}.png`)
- **Tabular Data Extraction** (LEFT PANEL):
  - Market, Data Analyzed period, Net/Asset Performance %
  - Beta, Positions, Wins %, Losses %, Max DD %
  - Average Win/Loss %, Average Return %, Rew/Risk Ratio
  - Expectancy, Exposure %, Avg. Length, Sharpe, Sortino
  - Win Streak max/avg, Loss Streak max/avg
  - Net Perf 1y, Trades/Month, R. vol

- **Seasonality Chart Extraction** (RIGHT PANEL):
  - **CRITICAL**: Extract each month's percentage with extreme precision
  - Monthly performance percentages (Jan-Dec bars) - VALIDATE EACH BAR HEIGHT
  - Current month timing and historical strength - DOUBLE-CHECK CURRENT MONTH
  - Positive/negative period patterns
  - Mean change % trend line
  - Best/worst performing months identification
  - **MANDATORY**: Cross-reference bar heights with percentage labels if visible

**Step 2: Fundamental Analysis Integration** (`@data/outputs/fundamental_analysis/{TICKER}_{YYYYMMDD}.md`)
- Extract investment thesis and key business drivers
- Identify valuation metrics (P/E, PEG, enterprise value ratios)
- Note growth catalysts and risk factors
- Extract price targets and analyst sentiment

**Step 3: Technical Context** (`@data/raw/analysis_misc/{TICKER}_{YYYYMMDD}.md`)
- Extract current chart patterns and technical signals
- Note relative performance vs benchmarks
- Identify support/resistance levels or trend analysis
- **Supplement with Yahoo Finance service class**:
  - Use `python scripts/yahoo_finance_service.py info TICKER` for current price/volume
  - Use `python scripts/yahoo_finance_service.py history TICKER` for recent performance
  - Cross-reference with real-time market data for validation
  - Benefit from automatic caching, retry logic, and error handling

**Step 4: Strategy Parameters from CSV** (`@data/raw/analysis_strategy/{TICKER}_{YYYYMMDD}.csv`)
- **REQUIRED**: Extract strategy type and window parameters regardless of TrendSpider availability
- Parse CSV headers: Strategy Type, Short Window, Long Window
- Format as: "dual [SMA/EMA] ([short]/[long]) cross strategy"
- Use for strategy identification in post content
- Cross-reference performance metrics for validation only

**Data Priority Hierarchy:**
1. TrendSpider tabular metrics override all other performance data
2. TrendSpider seasonality chart is authoritative for timing analysis
3. Fundamental analysis provides investment context
4. Technical misc provides current setup context
5. CSV data used only for missing metrics validation

**CRITICAL VALIDATION REQUIREMENTS:**
1. **Seasonality Accuracy**: Read each monthly bar height with extreme care
2. **Current Month Verification**: Confirm current month percentage matches visual bar
3. **Metric Cross-Check**: Validate key metrics against multiple visible sources
4. **Data Consistency**: Flag any metrics that seem inconsistent or outlying

### Bespoke Hook Generation

**CRITICAL FORMATTING REQUIREMENT: NO BOLD FORMATTING ALLOWED**
- Do not use asterisks (*) for bold text anywhere in the generated content
- Use plain text throughout all sections
- Emphasis should be achieved through emojis, structure, and word choice only

**Hook Creation Protocol (280 character limit):**

**Step 1: Analyze Performance Highlights**
- Identify the most compelling metric (total return %, reward/risk ratio, win rate, drawdown reduction)
- Extract strategy parameters: [SMA/EMA] ([short]/[long])
- Note any standout seasonal strength or technical setup

**Step 2: Generate Unique Hook Based on Data**

**Hook Creation Framework:**

1. **Identify Standout Metrics** (in priority order):
   - Exceptional total return (>1000%)
   - High reward/risk ratio (>3.0)
   - Strong current month seasonality (>65%)
   - Low win rate with asymmetric returns (<45% win but high R/R)
   - Significant drawdown reduction vs buy-and-hold
   - Compelling pattern confluence (technical + fundamental)
   - Notable streak statistics
   - Exceptional Sharpe/Sortino ratios

2. **Craft Natural Hook** (280 characters max):
   - Lead with emoji (📈, 🚨, 🔥, 💎, 🎯)
   - Include $TICKER and strategy parameters naturally
   - Highlight 1-2 most compelling metrics
   - End with implied action or curiosity driver

3. **Hook Writing Guidelines**:
   - Use active voice and present tense
   - Include specific numbers, not generalizations
   - Balance excitement with credibility
   - Avoid clichés like "This one simple trick"
   - Make the strategy parameters flow naturally
   - Create urgency through timing or confluence

**Example Hook Constructions:**
- "📈 $TICKER dual SMA (X/Y) cross delivered Z% returns with just A% win rate - here's how asymmetric risk/reward creates wealth."
- "🚨 $TICKER flashed a rare SMA (X/Y) entry signal today with Z% historical returns and perfect seasonal timing in [Month]."
- "🔥 This $TICKER EMA (X/Y) strategy cuts drawdown by Z% while capturing A% of upside - defensive edge meets growth."
- "💎 $TICKER SMA (X/Y) cross: Z trades, A% wins, but winners average B% vs C% losses. Math > luck."
- "🎯 $TICKER dual SMA (X/Y) triggered today as [pattern] completes and [fundamental catalyst] accelerates."
