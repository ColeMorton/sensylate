## Phase 0: Comparative Discovery Integration Protocol

**0.1 Comparative Discovery Data Extraction and Validation**
```
COMPARATIVE DISCOVERY INTEGRATION WORKFLOW:
1. Load Comparative Discovery Data
   → Extract ticker_1, ticker_2, and date from discovery_file parameter
   → Load comparative discovery JSON: {TICKER_1}_vs_{TICKER_2}_{YYYYMMDD}_discovery.json
   → Validate fundamental analysis dependency completeness and data quality metrics
   → Extract cross-stock confidence scores and comparative intelligence assessments

2. Fundamental Analysis Data Integration
   → Load fundamental analysis files for both stocks from aggregated discovery data
   → Extract economic context comparison and policy implications from both analyses
   → Integrate cross-stock economic sensitivity matrices and interest rate environment impact
   → Map comparative economic context to sector-specific and cross-sector implications

3. Cross-Stock Data Quality Assessment
   → Validate fundamental analysis data completeness (target: ≥95% for both stocks)
   → Extract cross-validated financial metrics and consistency verification
   → Assess comparative economic context integration and policy impact alignment
   → Propagate comparative discovery confidence scores to analysis framework

4. Validation Enhancement Check
   → Search for existing validation file: {TICKER_1}_vs_{TICKER_2}_{YYYYMMDD}_validation.json
   → If found: Apply validation-driven enhancements targeting 9.5+ comparative scores
   → If not found: Proceed with institutional-quality baseline comparative analysis

5. **MANDATORY Comparative Data Preservation Protocol**
   → **CRITICAL: Preserve ALL comparative discovery data in analysis output**
   → Load complete comparative sections: market_data_comparison, company_overviews, economic_context_integration
   → Preserve fundamental analysis dependency validation status and data quality scores
   → Maintain cross-sector intelligence data and comparative competitive metrics
   → Ensure current prices and economic indicators are inherited for both stocks
   → FAIL-FAST if any critical comparative discovery data is missing or incomplete
```

**0.2 Comparative Data Integration**
```
COMPARATIVE METRICS INTEGRATION PROCESS:
Step 1: Cross-Stock Financial Intelligence Extraction
   → Extract comparative financial ratios and metrics with cross-validation confidence scores
   → Load comparative business model intelligence and revenue stream analysis
   → Integrate cross-stock business-specific KPIs and operational metrics comparison
   → Map cross-sector competitive intelligence and industry positioning data

Step 2: Fundamental Analysis Quality Integration
   → Monitor fundamental analysis data quality and completeness for both stocks
   → Leverage A-F grade financial health assessments for comparative scoring
   → Use economic context confidence scores for comparative risk assessment
   → Enable cross-stock validation and consistency verification

Step 3: Comparative Economic Context Mapping
   → Map comparative economic sensitivity to policy implications for both stocks
   → Integrate cross-stock yield curve impact and interest rate sensitivity analysis
   → Apply comparative business cycle positioning and economic resilience assessment
   → Use comparative risk appetite and market sentiment correlation analysis

Step 4: Comparative Confidence Score Propagation
   → Inherit high-confidence scores from both fundamental analysis inputs
   → Apply cross-stock data consistency validation to comparative analytical confidence
   → Maintain institutional-grade comparative quality standards (9.0+ baseline)
   → Target enhanced comparative analysis scores of 9.5+ through cross-validation integration

Step 5: **Complete Comparative Discovery Data Inheritance Validation**
   → **MANDATORY: Verify ALL comparative discovery sections are preserved**
   → Validate current price data integrity and consistency for both stocks
   → Confirm comparative economic context preservation and cross-stock integration
   → Ensure fundamental analysis dependency validation status is maintained
   → Preserve comparative company overviews and cross-sector competitive intelligence
   → CRITICAL: Comparative analysis must contain discovery data PLUS comparative analysis additions

## Comparative Analysis Execution Protocol

### Pre-Execution
1. **Phase 0A Validation Check** (if validation_enhancement enabled)
   - Check for existing validation file: {TICKER_1}_vs_{TICKER_2}_{YYYYMMDD}_validation.json
   - If found, execute Phase 0A Enhancement Protocol for comparative analysis optimization
   - If not found, proceed with standard comparative analysis workflow
2. **MANDATORY Comparative Discovery Data Inheritance Validation**
   - **CRITICAL: Load ALL comparative discovery data sections for preservation**
   - **FAIL-FAST: Validate fundamental analysis file existence for both stocks**
   - Validate current price data integrity and consistency for both stocks
   - Confirm comparative market data completeness (market cap, volume, beta, 52-week range for both)
   - Preserve comparative company overview information for both stocks
   - Maintain comparative economic context integration (Fed rates, yield curve impact differential)
   - Ensure fundamental analysis dependency validation status is inherited
   - Preserve cross-sector intelligence and comparative competitive metrics
   - **FAIL-FAST if any critical comparative discovery data is missing**
3. **Validate fundamental analysis A-F grade integration for both stocks**
4. **Cross-validate comparative financial data consistency** - verify all figures match fundamental analysis exactly
5. **Cross-stock investment portfolio validation** - confirm comparative assessment capabilities
6. **Critical Comparative Calculation Verification**: Cross-validate all comparative metrics from fundamental analysis data
7. **Precision Standards**: Use exact figures from both fundamental analysis outputs, no approximations
