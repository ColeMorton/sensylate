**Command Classification**: üìä **Core Product Command**
**Knowledge Domain**: `social-media-strategy`
**Outputs To**: `./data/outputs/twitter_trade_history/` *(Core Product Command - outputs to product directories)*

## MANDATORY: Pre-Execution Coordination

**CRITICAL**: Before any trading performance content generation, integrate with Content Lifecycle Management system:

### Step 1: Pre-Execution Consultation
```bash
python team-workspace/coordination/pre-execution-consultation.py twitter-trade-history social-media-strategy "trading performance social post for {analysis}"
```

### Step 2: Handle Consultation Results
Based on consultation response:
- **proceed**: Continue with trading performance content generation
- **coordinate_required**: Contact relevant command owners for collaboration
- **avoid_duplication**: Reference existing content instead of creating new
- **update_existing**: Use superseding workflow to update existing content

### Step 3: Workspace Validation
```bash
python3 team-workspace/shared/validate-before-execution.py twitter-trade-history
```

**Only proceed with content generation if consultation and validation are successful.**

## Content Optimization Guidelines

### Engagement Mechanics
1. **Lead with Performance**: Specific percentages, trade counts, win rates
2. **Show Transparency**: Include both wins and losses for credibility
3. **Use Emojis Strategically**: 1-2 relevant emojis max for visual appeal
4. **Create Educational Value**: Share insights that help followers learn
5. **Include Specific Examples**: Real trades with real results

### Writing Style Requirements
- **Plain Language**: No jargon without explanation
- **Active Voice**: "Strategy delivered" not "Strategy was delivering"
- **Specific Claims**: "+16.58% return" not "significant return"
- **Present Tense**: Create immediacy and relevance
- **Confident Tone**: Back analysis with actual trade data

### Character Count Optimization
- **Target Length**: 280 characters per tweet (can thread if needed)
- **Tweet 1**: Hook + core performance metrics
- **Tweet 2** (if needed): Supporting trade examples
- **Tweet 3** (if needed): Insights/lessons/next steps
