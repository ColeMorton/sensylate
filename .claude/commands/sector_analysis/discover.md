# Sector Analyst Discover

**DASV Phase 1: Multi-Company Sector Data Collection and Context Gathering**

Comprehensive sector-wide financial data collection and market intelligence gathering for institutional-quality sector analysis with investment recommendation synthesis using systematic discovery protocols and researcher sub-agent orchestration.

## Purpose

The Sector Analysis Discovery phase defines the requirements for systematic collection and initial structuring of all data required for comprehensive sector analysis with investment recommendation synthesis. This specification focuses on **what** sector data and multi-company intelligence is needed rather than **how** to obtain it, delegating technical implementation to the researcher sub-agent.

**Expected Output Schema**: `/{SCRIPTS_BASE}/schemas/sector_analysis_discovery_schema.json`
**Researcher Sub Task**: Use the researcher sub-agent to execute sector analysis discovery. Ensure output conforms to `/{SCRIPTS_BASE}/schemas/sector_analysis_discovery_schema.json`.
