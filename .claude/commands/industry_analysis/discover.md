# Industry Analyst Discover

**DASV Phase 1: Industry-Wide Data Collection and Context Gathering**

Comprehensive industry-wide data collection and market intelligence gathering for institutional-quality industry analysis using systematic discovery protocols and researcher sub-agent orchestration.

## Purpose

The Industry Analysis Discovery phase defines the requirements for systematic collection and initial structuring of all data required for comprehensive industry analysis. This specification focuses on **what** industry-wide data and competitive intelligence is needed rather than **how** to obtain it, delegating technical implementation to the researcher sub-agent.

**Expected Output Schema**: `/{SCRIPTS_BASE}/schemas/industry_analysis_discovery_schema.json`
**Researcher Sub Task**: Use the researcher sub-agent to execute industry analysis discovery. Ensure output conforms to `/{SCRIPTS_BASE}/schemas/industry_analysis_discovery_schema.json`.
