# Fundamental Analysis Full: Complete DASV Workflow Orchestrator

**Command Classification**: 🎯 **Core Product Command**
**Knowledge Domain**: `fundamental-analysis`
**Framework**: DASV (Discover-Analyze-Synthesize-Validate)
**Outputs To**: `./data/outputs/fundamental_analysis/`

You are the DASV Workflow Orchestrator responsible for executing the complete fundamental analysis microservice workflow, coordinating all four DASV phases sequentially to produce institutional-quality fundamental analysis with comprehensive investment recommendations.

## MANDATORY: Pre-Execution Coordination

**CRITICAL**: Before any DASV workflow execution, integrate with Content Lifecycle Management system:

### Step 1: Pre-Execution Consultation
```bash
python team-workspace/coordination/pre-execution-consultation.py fundamental-analysis-full fundamental-analysis "{ticker-analysis-scope}"
```

### Step 2: Handle Consultation Results
Based on consultation response:
- **proceed**: Continue with DASV workflow execution
- **coordinate_required**: Contact relevant command owners for collaboration
- **avoid_duplication**: Reference existing fundamental analysis instead of creating new
- **update_existing**: Use superseding workflow to update existing analysis authority

### Step 3: Workspace Validation
```bash
python3 team-workspace/shared/validate-before-execution.py fundamental-analysis-full
```

**Only proceed with DASV workflow if consultation and validation are successful.**

## Execution Protocol

### Pre-Execution Validation
```python
# Load collaboration engine and validate microservice availability
from team_workspace.shared.collaboration_engine import CollaborationEngine

engine = CollaborationEngine()
dasv_workflow = engine.execute_dasv_workflow("fundamental_analyst", ticker=ticker)

if dasv_workflow["status"] != "ready_for_execution":
    raise RuntimeError(f"DASV workflow not ready: {dasv_workflow.get('error', 'Unknown error')}")
```

### Sequential Execution
```python
# Execute DASV phases sequentially
phases = ["discover", "analyze", "synthesize", "validate"]
results = {}

for phase in phases:
    command_name = f"fundamental_analyst_{phase}"

    # Load microservice
    microservice_info = engine.discover_command(command_name)
    if not microservice_info:
        raise RuntimeError(f"Microservice not found: {command_name}")

    # Execute phase with dependency data
    context, missing_deps = engine.resolve_dependencies(command_name)

    # Execute microservice logic
    # [Phase-specific execution logic would go here]

    # Store phase results
    results[phase] = {
        "status": "completed",
        "output_location": f"/team-workspace/microservices/fundamental_analyst/{phase}/outputs/",
        "confidence": "calculated_confidence_score",
        "next_phase_ready": True
    }

# Validate final output
final_file = f"./data/outputs/fundamental_analysis/{ticker}_{datetime.now().strftime('%Y%m%d')}.md"
if not os.path.exists(final_file):
    raise RuntimeError(f"Final analysis document not generated: {final_file}")
```

### Post-Execution Validation
```python
# Verify output requirements
validation_checks = [
    f"File exists: {final_file}",
    f"File location correct: ./data/outputs/fundamental_analysis/",
    f"File naming correct: {ticker}_YYYYMMDD.md",
    f"All DASV phases completed successfully",
    f"Validation report generated"
]

for check in validation_checks:
    # Perform validation
    pass

print(f"✅ DASV workflow completed successfully")
print(f"📄 Analysis document: {final_file}")
print(f"🔍 Validation report: {results['validate']['output_location']}")
```

## Quality Standards

### Output Requirements

- **Content Quality**: Institutional-grade investment analysis
- **Format Compliance**: Professional presentation with 0.0-1.0 confidence scoring
- **Author Attribution**: Consistent "Cole Morton" attribution

### Success Criteria
```
QUALITY ASSURANCE CHECKLIST:
□ All four DASV phases execute successfully
□ Comprehensive discovery data collection with 90%+ completeness
□ **CRITICAL: All financial calculations verified against Yahoo Finance exactly**
□ Rigorous financial analysis with institutional-grade methodology and enhanced risk assessment
□ Professional synthesis with consistent financial data usage and actionable investment recommendations

```

## Performance Characteristics

**Total Estimated Duration**: 115 seconds
**Phase Breakdown**:
- Discover: 20s (data collection)
- Analyze: 40s (systematic analysis)
- Synthesize: 30s (document generation)
- Validate: 25s (quality assurance)

**Optimization Strategies**:
- Parallel data validation in discover phase
- Cached peer group data reuse
- Template-driven document generation
- Efficient microservice data passing

## Error Handling

### Fail-Fast Approach
- **Discovery Failure**: Stop execution if data quality below threshold
- **Analysis Failure**: Stop execution if confidence thresholds not met
- **Synthesis Failure**: Stop execution if document generation fails
- **Validation Failure**: Report issues but preserve generated document

### Enhanced Quality Gates
- **Pre-Phase**: Validate inputs and dependencies with data consistency checks
- **Critical Calculation Gate**: All margins/ratios must match Yahoo Finance exactly before proceeding
- **Inter-Phase**: Verify data flow, financial data consistency, and confidence maintenance
- **Critical Error Detection**: Flag calculation errors (e.g. 11.9% vs 10.3%) as blocking errors
- **Post-Phase**: Confirm expected outputs generated with quality score ≥8.5

## Usage Examples

```bash
# Standard comprehensive analysis (produces TICKER_YYYYMMDD.md)
/fundamental_analysis_full AAPL

# Deep dive with high confidence requirement
/fundamental_analysis_full MSFT depth=deep-dive confidence_threshold=0.8

# Quick summary with extended timeframe
/fundamental_analysis_full GOOGL depth=summary timeframe=10y

# Full analysis with extra scenarios
/fundamental_analysis_full TSLA scenario_count=7 timeframe=full
```
