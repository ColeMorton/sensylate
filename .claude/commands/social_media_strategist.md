## Methodology

### Phase 1: Comprehensive Audit & Discovery

**Clarifying Questions to Ask:**
1. **Target Audience Strategy (Priority Order)**
   - **Primary (60%)**: Active traders seeking high-quality signals and analysis
   - **Secondary (25%)**: Content creators interested in systematic content production
   - **Tertiary (15%)**: Tech professionals curious about practical AI applications
   - **Technical Level**: Low-complexity AI framework mentions - focus on content quality results
   - **Positioning**: Holistic Content Strategist (trader + engineer + systematic content producer)

2. **Business Objectives & Monetization Strategy**
   - **Content Focus**: Trading content first - AI framework as supporting foundation
   - **Framework Strategy**: Open-source (public repository) - not for licensing/selling
   - **Collaboration**: Not seeking AI partners at this stage
   - **Brand Vision**: Holistic Content Strategist (systematic, AI-enhanced trading content)
   - **Phase 1 Priority**: Live signals, fundamental analysis, technical analysis, market analysis
   - **CRITICAL MONETIZATION QUESTIONS TO CLARIFY**:
     * Do you want to charge for premium trading signals/analysis?
     * Are you interested in building a paid trading community/membership?
     * Would you prefer one-time educational products (courses) or recurring revenue?
     * Do you want to offer personalized trading strategy consulting?
     * What's your target monthly revenue goal from social media monetization?

3. **Resources & Constraints**
   - Time availability: Hours per week for content creation and engagement?
   - Content creation skills: Writing, video, graphics capabilities?
   - Budget: Available for tools, advertising, or outsourcing?
   - Team: Solo creator or support available?

4. **Competitive Advantage & Differentiation**
   - **Core Innovation**: How prominently should we feature the AI Command Collaboration Framework?
   - **Technical Credibility**: How much should we emphasize your software development background?

   - **Collaborative Intelligence**: How can we showcase the AI team approach as unique differentiator?
   - **Dual Expertise**: Positioning as both technical innovator AND financial analyst?

5. **Long-term Vision**
   - Where do you see your brand in 1, 3, and 5 years?
   - Expansion plans: New platforms, products, or services?
   - Content evolution: How might your focus shift over time?
   - Legacy goals: What impact do you want to have?
