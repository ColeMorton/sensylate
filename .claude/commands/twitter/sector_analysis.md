## Phase 0A: Existing Post Enhancement Protocol

**0A.1 Validation File Discovery**
```
EXISTING POST IMPROVEMENT WORKFLOW:
1. Check input pattern for validation file path:
   → Pattern: data/outputs/twitter_sector_analysis/validation/{SECTOR}_{YYYYMMDD}_validation.json
   → Alternative: data/outputs/sector_analysis/validation/{SECTOR}_{YYYYMMDD}_validation.json
   → Extract SECTOR_YYYYMMDD from validation file path

2. If validation file path provided:
   → ROLE CHANGE: From "new post creator" to "Twitter sector post optimization specialist"
   → OBJECTIVE: Improve post engagement, accuracy, and compliance through systematic enhancement
   → METHOD: Examination → Validation → Optimization → Validation-Driven Improvement

3. If standard SECTOR_YYYYMMDD format provided:
   → Proceed with standard new post creation workflow (Data Sources & Integration onwards)
```

**0A.2 Post Enhancement Workflow (When Validation File Path Detected)**
```
SYSTEMATIC ENHANCEMENT PROCESS:
Step 1: Examine Existing Post
   → Read the original post file: {SECTOR}_{YYYYMMDD}.md
   → Extract current template selection, hook effectiveness, and content structure
   → Identify data sources used and accuracy claims
   → Map engagement elements and character count optimization

Step 2: Examine Validation Assessment
   → Read validation file: twitter_sector_analysis/validation/{SECTOR}_{YYYYMMDD}_validation.json
   → Focus on sector data accuracy issues and content improvement areas
   → Extract cross-sector comparison discrepancies and ETF data conflicts
   → Note economic context concerns and disclaimer requirements

Step 3: Data Source Conflict Resolution
   → Apply sector analysis authority protocol for data discrepancies
   → Re-analyze sector ETF data as authoritative source for pricing
   → Update any conflicting performance metrics using sector analysis data
   → Cross-validate with economic indicators for consistency checking

Step 4: Enhancement Implementation
   → Address each validation point systematically
   → Strengthen explicit disclaimers and risk language (not just implied)
   → Improve data source attribution and confidence levels
   → Enhance professional presentation standards
   → Update real-time data integration and economic context
   → Apply institutional quality standards throughout content

Step 5: Production-Ready Post Output
   → OVERWRITE original post file: {SECTOR}_{YYYYMMDD}.md
   → Seamlessly integrate all improvements with validation-driven enhancements
   → Maintain engaging Twitter format without enhancement artifacts
   → Ensure post meets institutional quality standards
   → Include explicit disclaimers and data source attribution
   → Deliver publication-ready social media content with enhanced compliance
```

- **IF** (cross-sector ranking top 3 OR bottom 3 AND relative valuation extreme) → **Template B: Cross-Sector Comparison**
- **IF** (allocation guidance available AND risk-return profile complete) → **Template C: Allocation Strategy**
- **IF** (economic sensitivity analysis comprehensive AND correlations significant) → **Template D: Economic Sensitivity**
- **ELSE** → **Template E: ETF vs Stock Picking**
