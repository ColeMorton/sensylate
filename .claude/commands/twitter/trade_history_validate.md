## Microservice Integration

**Framework**: DASV Phase 4
**Role**: twitter_trade_historian
**Action**: validate
**Input Parameter**: Post filename - format: {ANALYSIS_NAME}_{YYYYMMDD}.md
**Output Location**: `./{DATA_OUTPUTS}/twitter/trade_history/validation/`
**Previous Phase**: twitter_trade_history (monolithic synthesis)
**Next Phase**: None (final validation phase)

## Parameters

- `post_filename`: Path to generated post file (required) - format: {ANALYSIS_NAME}_{YYYYMMDD}.md
- `confidence_threshold`: Minimum confidence requirement - `8.5` | `9.0` | `9.5` (optional, default: 9.0)
- `validation_depth`: Validation rigor - `standard` | `comprehensive` | `institutional` (optional, default: comprehensive)
- `compliance_check`: Enable regulatory compliance validation - `true` | `false` (optional, default: true)
- `engagement_scoring`: Enable engagement prediction validation - `true` | `false` (optional, default: true)

## Comprehensive Twitter Trade History Validation Methodology

**Before beginning validation, establish context:**
- Extract analysis name and date from post filename
- Locate ALL source data files for cross-validation:
  - Trade History Analysis: `./{DATA_OUTPUTS}/trade_history/{ANALYSIS_NAME}_{YYYYMMDD}.md`
  - Live Signals (supplemental): `./{DATA_OUTPUTS}/live_signals/{TICKER}_{YYYYMMDD}.md`
  - Internal Reports (validation): `./data/raw/internal_trading_reports/`
- Initialize Yahoo Finance MCP server for real-time market context validation
- Document validation timestamp and trading environment context

### Phase 1: Trading Performance Data Accuracy Validation

**Trade History Source Verification**
```
TRADING PERFORMANCE VALIDATION PROTOCOL:
1. Trade History Source Data Verification
   → Cross-validate all trading metrics against source analysis document
   → Verify closed position calculations (win rate, profit factor, returns)
   → Check individual trade details (entry/exit, duration, returns)
   → Confirm YTD performance and benchmark comparisons
   → Confidence threshold: 9.8/10 (trading metrics require precision)

2. Performance Calculation Accuracy
   → Validate win rate calculations: (wins / total trades) * 100
   → Verify profit factor: (sum of wins / sum of losses)
   → Check YTD return calculations and time period accuracy
   → Confirm average trade duration and statistical aggregations
   → Confidence threshold: 9.7/10 (mathematical precision required)

3. Strategy Parameter Verification
   → Cross-check SMA/EMA parameters against source analysis
   → Verify signal quality ratings and distribution
   → Validate strategy effectiveness claims and evidence
   → Confirm risk-reward ratios and breakeven thresholds
   → Confidence threshold: 9.5/10 (strategy accuracy critical)

4. Individual Trade Attribution
   → Verify top performing trades with exact returns and durations
   → Check worst performing trades with accurate loss percentages
   → Validate ticker symbols, entry/exit dates, and holding periods
   → Confirm trade quality ratings and strategy classifications
   → Confidence threshold: 9.6/10 (trade accuracy essential)
```

### Phase 2: Template Selection & Content Structure Validation

**Twitter Content Optimization Assessment**
```
CONTENT STRUCTURE VALIDATION:
1. Template Selection Appropriateness

   → Validate Template A (Summary), B (Showcase), C (Learning), D (Real-time), or E (Statistical)
   → Check template structure adherence and content flow optimization
   → Assess template effectiveness for specific performance story
   → Confidence threshold: 9.0/10 (template optimization standards)

2. Performance Narrative Coherence
   → Verify performance story flows logically from data to insights
   → Check balance between wins/losses and transparency
   → Validate educational value and actionable insights inclusion
   → Confirm credibility through specific data point backing
   → Confidence threshold: 9.2/10 (narrative quality standards)

3. Trading Transparency Standards
   → Verify both wins and losses are represented appropriately
   → Check risk disclosure and performance disclaimer presence
   → Validate balanced presentation of trading results
