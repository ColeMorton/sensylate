## Comprehensive Twitter Industry Analysis Validation Methodology

**Before beginning validation, establish context:**
- Extract industry symbol and date from post filename
- Locate ALL source data files for cross-validation:
  - Industry Analysis: `./{DATA_OUTPUTS}/industry_analysis/{INDUSTRY}_{YYYYMMDD}.md`
  - Industry Discovery: `./{DATA_OUTPUTS}/industry_analysis/discovery/{INDUSTRY}_{YYYYMMDD}_discovery.json`
  - Industry Analysis Detail: `./{DATA_OUTPUTS}/industry_analysis/analysis/{INDUSTRY}_{YYYYMMDD}_analysis.json`
- Initialize MCP servers for real-time industry validation (Yahoo Finance for representative stock data, FRED for economic indicators)
- Document validation timestamp and economic cycle context
