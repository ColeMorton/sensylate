# Content Evaluator: Expert Analytical Content Validation System

**Command Classification**: üéØ **Core Product Command**
**Knowledge Domain**: `content-quality`
**Outputs To**: `./outputs/evaluations/`

Expert analytical content validation system with systematic research methodology and standardized evaluation framework.

## MANDATORY: Pre-Execution Coordination

**CRITICAL**: Before any content evaluation activities, integrate with Content Lifecycle Management system:

### Step 1: Pre-Execution Consultation
```bash
python team-workspace/coordination/pre-execution-consultation.py content-evaluator content-evaluation "{content-evaluation-scope}"
```

### Step 2: Handle Consultation Results
Based on consultation response:
- **proceed**: Continue with content evaluation
- **coordinate_required**: Contact relevant command owners for collaboration
- **avoid_duplication**: Reference existing content evaluation instead of creating new
- **update_existing**: Use superseding workflow to update existing evaluation authority

### Step 3: Workspace Validation
```bash
python3 team-workspace/shared/validate-before-execution.py content-evaluator
```

**Only proceed with content evaluation if consultation and validation are successful.**

## Parameters

- `filename`: Target file for evaluation (required, must exist in project)

## Systematic Evaluation Methodology

**Before beginning evaluation, establish context:**
- Document analysis date and data freshness requirements
- Identify content type (financial analysis, market research, strategic assessment)
- Extract stock symbols/tickers for real-time data validation via Yahoo Finance service class
- Assess claimed confidence levels and methodology transparency
- Note any explicit limitations or assumptions stated

**Phase 1: Structured Content Analysis**
1. **Claim Categorization**: Sort all assertions into:
   - Quantitative claims (financial metrics, market data, growth rates)
   - Qualitative assessments (competitive positioning, risk factors)
   - Predictive statements (forecasts, scenario analysis)
   - Methodological assumptions (valuation models, data sources)

2. **Evidence Mapping**: For each claim, identify:
   - Primary source requirements (SEC filings, official reports)
   - Verification methodology needed
   - Potential conflict indicators
   - Time-sensitivity factors

**Phase 2: Multi-Source Validation Protocol**
3. **Primary Source Verification**:
   - Cross-reference ALL quantitative data with official sources (10-K, 10-Q, earnings calls)
   - Validate regulatory information via authoritative bodies (SEC, FDA, etc.)
   - **Use Yahoo Finance service class** for real-time financial data validation:
     - `python scripts/yahoo_finance_service.py info [SYMBOL]` - Current stock metrics
     - `python scripts/yahoo_finance_service.py financials [SYMBOL]` - Financial statements
     - `python scripts/yahoo_finance_service.py history [SYMBOL] [PERIOD]` - Historical data
   - Verify timeline accuracy against actual events

4. **Consistency Analysis**:
   - Compare claims against peer analysis and consensus estimates
   - Check internal logical consistency within the document
   - Identify conflicts between stated confidence and supporting evidence
   - Assess methodology appropriateness for stated conclusions

**Phase 3: Risk-Calibrated Assessment**
5. **Failure Mode Detection**:
   - Data staleness beyond acceptable thresholds
   - Circular reasoning or confirmation bias patterns
   - Overconfidence in uncertain domains
   - Missing critical risk factors or alternative scenarios

6. **Impact Prioritization**:
   - Classify errors by potential decision impact (Critical/High/Medium/Low)
   - Weight accuracy issues by materiality to core thesis
   - Identify "thesis-breaking" vs "refinement-needed" discrepancies

**Phase 4: Standardized Scoring & Reporting**
7. **Evidence-Based Rating System**:
   - Score each category using defined benchmarks
   - Document confidence intervals for all assessments
   - Provide explicit reasoning for all major rating decisions
   - Include "unknown/unverifiable" designations where appropriate

8. **Actionable Report Generation**: Produce structured evaluation with:
   - Executive summary with overall reliability score
   - Category-specific accuracy breakdown with evidence links
   - Critical gaps requiring immediate attention
   - Decision-impact assessment (safe to use/use with caution/do not use)
   - Recommended follow-up research priorities

## Standardized Evaluation Framework

## Yahoo Finance Bridge Integration

**Real-Time Financial Data Validation Protocol**:

When evaluating financial content, ALWAYS use the Yahoo Finance Bridge script for current market data validation. This ensures accuracy against live market conditions rather than potentially stale web search results.

**Required Bridge Commands for Financial Content**:

1. **Stock Information Validation**:
   ```bash
   python scripts/yahoo_finance_bridge.py info [SYMBOL]
   ```
   **Validates**: Current price, market cap, P/E ratio, 52-week range, volume, sector/industry, analyst recommendations

2. **Financial Statements Verification**:
   ```bash
   python scripts/yahoo_finance_bridge.py financials [SYMBOL]
   ```
   **Validates**: Income statement metrics, balance sheet data, cash flow statements

3. **Historical Performance Check**:
   ```bash
   python scripts/yahoo_finance_bridge.py history [SYMBOL] [PERIOD]
   ```
   **Validates**: Historical price movements, growth calculations, trend analysis
   **Periods**: 1d, 5d, 1mo, 3mo, 6mo, 1y, 2y, 5y, 10y, ytd, max

**Integration Workflow**:

**Step 1: Symbol Extraction**
- Scan content for stock symbols/tickers (e.g., HIMS, AAPL, TSLA)
- Note claimed stock prices, valuations, and financial metrics
- Identify date ranges for historical data validation

**Step 2: Real-Time Validation**
- Run bridge commands for each identified symbol
- Compare bridge results with content claims
- Calculate variance percentages for quantitative metrics
- Flag discrepancies exceeding accuracy thresholds

**Step 3: Data Quality Assessment**
- **Primary Data** (0-5% variance): Grade A reliability
- **Minor Discrepancy** (5-10% variance): Grade B with timing notation
- **Significant Error** (10-25% variance): Grade C with methodology concerns
- **Major Inaccuracy** (>25% variance): Grade D/F requiring correction

**Bridge Data Reliability Standards**:
- Yahoo Finance provides real-time market data with <15 minute delay
- Financial statements updated quarterly from official SEC filings
- Historical data validated against exchange records
- Analyst recommendations aggregated from major financial institutions

**Error Handling & Limitations**:
- If bridge script fails, document limitation and use web search backup
- Note any symbols not available in Yahoo Finance database
- Handle market closure times and weekend data limitations
- Cross-reference unusual readings with secondary sources

## Usage

```
filename: /data/outputs/fundamental_analysis/COMPANY_DATE.md
```

Analyzes the specified file and generates comprehensive accuracy evaluation report.

## Self-Monitoring & Quality Assurance

**Pre-Evaluation Diagnostic Questions**:
- What is the claimed confidence level and is methodology adequate to support it?
- What are the highest-risk claims that could materially impact decisions?
- Which assertions require real-time data vs. historical verification?
- What stock symbols/tickers need validation via Yahoo Finance Bridge?
- Are there domain-specific validation requirements I need to consider?

**Post-Evaluation Validation Checklist**:
- [ ] Have I verified all quantitative claims against primary sources?
- [ ] Have I used Yahoo Finance Bridge to validate all stock-specific metrics?
- [ ] Can I defend every grade assignment with specific evidence?
- [ ] Would an expert in this domain reach similar conclusions?
- [ ] Are my recommendations proportionate to the evidence quality?
- [ ] Have I clearly separated what I know vs. what I cannot verify?

**Failure Mode Prevention**:
- **Confirmation Bias**: Actively seek evidence that contradicts original analysis
- **Authority Bias**: Verify prestigious sources just as rigorously as others
- **Anchoring**: Assess each claim independently before forming overall judgment
- **Overconfidence**: Include explicit uncertainty acknowledgments where appropriate

## Continuous Improvement Protocol

**After Each Evaluation**:
- Document any research limitations encountered
- Note sources that proved most/least reliable
