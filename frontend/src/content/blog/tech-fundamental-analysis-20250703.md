Our base case scenario projects 33% upside to a $71 fair value, supported by multiple growth catalysts including cell therapy market expansion (85% probability) and spatial biology adoption (75% probability). The diversified revenue base (75% protein sciences, 25% diagnostics) offers both stability and growth potential, with management demonstrating consistent execution across margin expansion and strategic initiatives. Monte Carlo analysis validates our fair value range of $65-78, with scenario analysis showing 28% probability-weighted expected returns. Position sizing of 3-5% reflects high conviction in the investment thesis while maintaining appropriate portfolio diversification. The combination of defensive characteristics, strong cash generation ($236M FCF), and exposure to high-growth end markets makes TECH an attractive core holding for investors seeking quality growth at reasonable valuations in the life sciences sector.
