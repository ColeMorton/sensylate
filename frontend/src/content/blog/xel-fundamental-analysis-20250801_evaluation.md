## Critical Findings Matrix

### ✅ Verified Claims (High Confidence)

- **Current Price**: $73.44 - EXACT match with Yahoo Finance and FMP
- **P/E Ratio**: 21.6 - EXACT match across all sources
- **Market Cap**: $42.36B - Verified within 0.01% variance
- **52-Week Range**: $56.69-$73.87 - Correctly stated (Yahoo: $56.69-$73.87)
- **BUY Recommendation**: Aligned with Yahoo Finance consensus "buy"
- **Target Price**: Analysis target $75-82 encompasses Yahoo consensus $76.27
- **Sector Classification**: "Utilities - Regulated Electric" correctly identified
- **Beta**: 0.37 stated aligns with FMP's 0.372
- **Fed Funds Rate**: 4.33% - Validated against FRED data
- **Confidence Scores**: 0.91/1.0 overall appropriately reflects analysis depth

### ⚠️ Questionable Claims (Medium Confidence)

- **Dividend Yield**: Stated 3.06% vs actual 3.15% (Yahoo Finance)
  - Variance: 0.09% - likely timing difference in data collection
  - Impact: Minimal - slightly understates income attraction
- **YTD Performance**: +32.3% claimed - requires independent verification
  - Current price near 52-week high ($73.44 vs $73.87) supports strong performance claim
- **Bitcoin Price**: $115.7k stated - significantly higher than typical 2025 levels
  - May be typo or forward projection - requires clarification

### ❌ Inaccurate Claims (Low Confidence)

- No material inaccuracies identified in core financial or valuation data

### ❓ Unverifiable Claims

- **Customer Count**: 3.7M electric customers - requires utility-specific sources
- **Rate Base Growth**: 5-7% projection - forward-looking estimate
- **Renewable Capacity Growth**: Qualitative assessment without specific metrics
- **Peer Performance Comparisons**: 14.3% peer average YTD requires sector index verification

## Decision Impact Assessment

**Thesis-Breaking Issues**: None identified
**Material Concerns**:

- Minor dividend yield discrepancy (immaterial 0.09% variance)
- Bitcoin price anomaly in economic sensitivity matrix (non-core metric)

**Refinement Needed**:

1. Update dividend yield to 3.15% for accuracy
2. Verify/correct Bitcoin price reference
3. Provide source for YTD performance claim

## Usage Recommendations

- **Safe for Decision-Making**: Yes - core investment thesis and valuation are sound
- **Required Corrections**:
  1. Update dividend yield from 3.06% to 3.15%
  2. Verify Bitcoin price or correct apparent typo
- **Follow-up Research**:
  1. Confirm YTD performance calculation methodology
  2. Verify peer group composition for performance comparison
- **Monitoring Requirements**:
  1. Track Fed funds rate changes given -0.62 correlation
  2. Monitor regulatory ROE approvals in 8-state territory
  3. Watch renewable capacity additions for growth validation

## Methodology Notes
