### Sensitivity Analysis

Key variables impact on fair value:

- **WACC**: ±100bps change = ±$15 (16%)
- **Terminal Growth**: ±0.5% change = ±$8 (9%)
- **Data Center Multiple**: ±5x change = ±$12 (13%)

## 🎬 Action Plan

### Entry Strategy

- **Optimal Entry**: Below $85 (15% margin of safety)
- **Accumulation Zone**: $85 - $95
- **Position Building**: Gradual on weakness, opportunistic on catalysts

### Monitoring Framework

**Weekly Indicators**:

- Stock Price: Alert if breaks below $90 support or above $110 resistance
- Interest Rates: Alert if 10-year Treasury moves >50bps

**Quarterly Checkpoints**:

- [ ] Data center leasing vs 125MW annual target
- [ ] AFFO growth vs guidance (11-13%)
- [ ] Debt metrics and refinancing progress
- [ ] Customer retention maintaining >97%
- [ ] Free cash flow improvement trajectory

### Exit Triggers

1. **Thesis Broken**: Customer retention falls below 95%, data center expansion stalls
2. **Valuation Target**: $120+ (20%+ premium to fair value)
3. **Better Opportunity**: REITs with <15x P/FFO and >5% yield
4. **Risk Materialization**: Debt/EBITDA >6x, refinancing difficulties

## 📋 Analysis Metadata

**Data Sources & Quality**:

- Primary Sources: SEC filings (9.0/10), earnings calls (8.5/10), investor relations (8.0/10)
- Data Completeness: 88%
- Latest Data Point: Q4 2024 earnings (Feb 2025)

**Methodology Notes**:

- Valuation Adjustments: REIT-specific metrics (AFFO, P/FFO) weighted heavily
- Peer Comparisons: Focused on data center REITs (DLR, EQIX) and storage specialists
- Risk Assessment: Emphasized interest rate sensitivity and execution risk given transformation

**Key Limitations**:

- Free Cash Flow: Negative FCF creates DCF valuation uncertainty
- Transformation Risk: Data center expansion success critical but uncertain
- Macro Sensitivity: REIT performance tied to interest rate environment
- Limited Trading History: Recent transformation makes historical analysis less relevant

**Areas Requiring Follow-up Research**:

- Detailed analysis of data center lease terms and pricing power
- Competitive positioning vs. hyperscale cloud providers
- ESG factors and sustainability initiatives impact on valuation
- Management track record on capital allocation and M&A execution

---

**Investment Summary**: Iron Mountain combines exceptional competitive moats in traditional records storage with promising data center growth opportunities. The company's 98% customer retention rate and 50-year average customer relationships create unparalleled business stability. However, high debt levels (5.0x leverage) and negative free cash flow present near-term challenges. The data center expansion offers compelling long-term growth potential, but execution risk and elevated valuation limit margin of safety. Current fair value analysis suggests modest downside risk, making this a HOLD for existing positions while awaiting better entry opportunities below $85 or significant deleveraging progress.
