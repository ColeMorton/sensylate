## üìä Statistical Significance Analysis

### Sample Size Assessment

- **Total Closed Trades**: 29 ‚úÖ **ADEQUATE** for portfolio-level analysis (minimum 25 achieved)
- **SMA Strategy**: 28 trades ‚úÖ **ADEQUATE** for individual analysis (minimum 15 achieved)
- **EMA Strategy**: 1 trade ‚ö†Ô∏è **MINIMAL** (requires 15+ for confidence)
- **Confidence Level**: 82.4% statistical adequacy score (target 80%+)

### Significance Testing

- **Win Rate vs Random (50%)**: p = 0.442 (not statistically different from random)
- **Alpha vs Benchmark**: Requires SPY comparison data for statistical testing
- **Strategy Performance**: Insufficient EMA sample for reliable SMA vs EMA comparison

### Confidence Intervals

- **Mean Return**: +2.23% ¬± 2.8% (95% CI: -0.6% to +5.1%)
- **Win Rate**: 55.17% ¬± 9.2% (95% CI: 46.0% to 64.3%)
- **Profit Factor**: 3.50 with uncertainty due to limited sample size
- **Strategy Comparison**: Cannot reliably compare until EMA reaches 15+ closed trades

### Statistical Limitations

‚ö†Ô∏è **STATISTICAL HONESTY**:

- EMA strategy has only 1 closed trade - insufficient for independent analysis
- Small sample creates wide confidence intervals (¬±9.2% for win rate)
- Performance may not persist with market regime changes
- Strategy optimization requires larger sample validation

   - AI catalyst stocks showing exceptional momentum
   - Cloud/semiconductor leadership with sustained trends
   - Implementation: Continue tech focus while monitoring concentration

2. **Medium-Term Holding Strategy** (62.5% win rate, 8-30 day window)

   - Optimal balance between trend capture and risk management
   - 15-30 day sweet spot for signal development
   - Implementation: Target 15-30 day average holding period

3. **Quality Signal Filtering** (Excellent quality: 70% win rate)

   - Implementation: Strengthen entry criteria with volume/momentum filters

### What Failed (Pattern Analysis)

1. **Financial Sector Exposure** (25% win rate, -6.9% portfolio drag)

   - Interest rate sensitivity and regulatory headwinds
   - Systematic underperformance across payment/insurance companies
   - Implementation: Reduce financial exposure until sector recovery

2. **Weak Initial Momentum Signals** (0% win rate for <2% first week gains)

   - Poor early momentum predicts failure with 100% accuracy
   - Lack of volume confirmation correlates with poor outcomes
   - Implementation: Exit signals showing <2% gains within 7 days

3. **Extended Duration Trades** (Declining efficiency >75 days)
