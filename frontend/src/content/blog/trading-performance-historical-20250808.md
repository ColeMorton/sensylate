## 🔬 Statistical Methodology

### Risk-Adjusted Performance Calculations

#### Sharpe Ratio Methodology
**Formula**: `Sharpe Ratio = (Mean Portfolio Return - Risk-Free Rate) / Portfolio Standard Deviation`  
**Risk-Free Rate**: 3-Month US Treasury Bill = 5.25% (as of August 8, 2025, Federal Reserve Economic Data)  
**Calculation Period**: Daily returns annualized using 252 trading days  
**Current Value**: 0.53 (below institutional target of 1.50, indicating room for improvement in risk-adjusted returns)  

#### Sortino Ratio Methodology  
**Formula**: `Sortino Ratio = (Mean Portfolio Return - Target Return) / Downside Deviation`  
**Target Return**: 0% (preservation of capital threshold)  
**Downside Deviation**: Standard deviation of negative returns only, excluding positive returns from volatility calculation  
**Current Value**: 1.64 (strong downside protection, focusing only on negative volatility)  

#### System Quality Number (SQN)
**Formula**: `SQN = (Mean R-Multiple × √Number of Trades) / Standard Deviation of R-Multiples`  
**R-Multiple**: Individual trade return divided by initial risk per trade  
**Interpretation Scale**: Excellent (>2.5), Above Average (1.25-2.5), Average (0.7-1.25), Below Average (<0.7)  
**Current Value**: 3.27 ✅ **EXCELLENT** (indicates high-quality trading system performance)  

### Statistical Testing Framework

#### Confidence Interval Calculations
**Win Rate Confidence**: Wilson Score Interval for binomial proportions (recommended for sample sizes <50)  
**Formula**: `p ± z√(p(1-p)/n + z²/4n²) / (1 + z²/n)`  
**Where**: p = observed proportion, n = sample size, z = 1.96 for 95% confidence  
**Current Result**: 62.86% ± 15.6% (95% CI: 47.3% to 78.4%)  

#### Return Significance Testing
**Test Type**: One-sample t-test comparing mean returns against zero (no profit hypothesis)  
**Formula**: `t = (sample mean - 0) / (sample standard deviation / √n)`  
**Degrees of Freedom**: n-1 = 37  
**Critical Value**: ±2.026 (two-tailed test, α = 0.05)  
**Current Result**: t = 3.27, p = 0.0023 ✅ **HIGHLY SIGNIFICANT**  

#### Power Analysis
**Statistical Power**: 87% (probability of correctly detecting meaningful performance difference)  
**Effect Size**: Medium (Cohen's d ≈ 0.5)  
**Alpha Level**: 0.05 (5% chance of Type I error)  
**Sample Size Adequacy**: 38 trades meets minimum requirements for portfolio-level conclusions  

### Distribution Analysis Methodology

#### Skewness Calculation
**Formula**: `Skewness = E[(X-μ)³] / σ³`  
**Interpretation**: Positive values indicate more frequent small gains with occasional large gains  
**Current Value**: +1.15 (moderate positive skew, indicating asymmetric return distribution favoring gains)  

#### Kurtosis Calculation  
**Formula**: `Kurtosis = E[(X-μ)⁴] / σ⁴`  
**Interpretation**: Values >3 indicate heavy tails (extreme outcomes more likely than normal distribution)  
**Current Value**: +1.31 (light tails, fewer extreme outliers than normal distribution)  

### Advanced Risk Metrics Methodology

#### Downside Deviation Calculation
**Formula**: `Downside Deviation = √(Σ(min(Ri - T, 0)²) / n)`  
**Where**: Ri = individual return, T = target return (0%), n = number of observations  
**Methodology**: Only negative deviations from target are included in calculation  
**Current Value**: 4.83% (measure of downside volatility, excluding upside volatility from risk calculation)  

#### P&L Standard Deviation Analysis
**Overall P&L StdDev**: 149.42% - comprehensive volatility measure across all position outcomes  
**Winner P&L StdDev**: 128.7% - consistency measurement among profitable trades  
**Loser P&L StdDev**: 57.3% ✅ - loss control consistency (lower is better for risk management)  
**Calculation Method**: Population standard deviation using all closed positions  

#### Recovery Time Methodology
**Definition**: Average number of trades required to recover from drawdown periods  
**Calculation**: Time-weighted analysis of consecutive loss periods and subsequent recovery  
**Current Metric**: 2.1 trades average recovery time with 91% recovery success rate  
**Framework**: Consecutive loss sequences analyzed for recovery pattern identification  

#### Profit Factor Framework
**Formula**: `Profit Factor = Total Gross Profits / Total Gross Losses`  
**Calculation**: Sum of all winning trades ÷ Sum of all losing trades (absolute values)  
**Current Value**: 6.28 ✅ **EXCELLENT** (target minimum 1.50, optimal >2.00)  
**Interpretation**: For every $1 lost, system generates $6.28 in profits  

#### Win/Loss Ratio Methodology
**Formula**: `Win/Loss Ratio = Average Winning Trade / Average Losing Trade`  
**Average Win**: +$46.03 (mean of all profitable trades)  
**Average Loss**: -$12.40 (mean of all losing trades, absolute value)  
**Current Ratio**: 3.71:1 ✅ **EXCELLENT** (target minimum 2.00:1)

## 🔬 Statistical Significance Analysis

### Sample Size Assessment
**Total Trades**: 38 closed trades ✅ **ADEQUATE** for portfolio-level analysis (minimum 25 achieved)  
**SMA Strategy**: 31 trades ✅ **STATISTICALLY RELIABLE** (95% confidence for independent analysis)  
**EMA Strategy**: 7 trades ⚠️ **MINIMAL** (requires 15+ for confidence, currently insufficient for reliable comparison)  
**Confidence Level**: Statistical confidence threshold achievement: 85.1% (adequate for institutional reporting)  
**Power Analysis**: Statistical power 87% for detecting meaningful performance differences vs random  

### Significance Testing Results
**Returns vs Zero**: t-statistic 3.27, p-value 0.0023 ✅ **HIGHLY SIGNIFICANT** positive returns confirmed  
**Win Rate vs Random (50%)**: p-value 0.018 ✅ **SIGNIFICANT** outperformance vs random chance  
**Strategy Performance Differential**: Insufficient EMA sample for reliable SMA vs EMA comparison testing  

### Confidence Intervals (95%)
**Mean Return**: 7.92% ± 4.91% (95% CI: 3.01% to 12.84%) showing positive expected return range  
**Sharpe Ratio**: 0.53 ± 0.34 (95% CI: 0.19 to 0.87) indicating consistent but improvable risk-adjusted returns  
**Win Rate**: 62.86% ± 15.6% (95% CI: 47.3% to 78.4%) wide confidence bounds due to sample size  
**Strategy Comparison**: Cannot reliably compare until EMA reaches 15+ closed trades for statistical adequacy  

### Statistical Limitations Disclosure
⚠️ **STATISTICAL LIMITATION**: EMA strategy has only 7 closed trades, insufficient for independent analysis or reliable comparison  
**Small Sample Impact**: Wide confidence intervals create uncertainty ranges, requiring larger sample validation  
**Methodology Honesty**: Performance may not persist with market regime changes - requires larger sample confirmation  
**Future Validation Required**: EMA strategy effectiveness cannot be statistically confirmed until 15+ trade threshold achieved
