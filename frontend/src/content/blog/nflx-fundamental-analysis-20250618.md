### Sensitivity Analysis

Key variables impact on fair value:

- **Subscriber Growth**: ¬±10% change = ¬±$85 (9.2%)
- **ARPU Growth**: ¬±10% change = ¬±$65 (7.0%)
- **Content Spending**: ¬±10% change = ¬±$45 (4.9%)

## üé¨ Action Plan

### Entry Strategy

- **Optimal Entry**: Below $850 (8% margin of safety)
- **Accumulation Zone**: Not recommended at current levels
- **Position Building**: Wait for correction or avoid

### Monitoring Framework

**Weekly Indicators**:

- Subscriber net additions: Alert if <5M quarterly
- Ad-tier penetration: Alert if growth <30% QoQ

**Quarterly Checkpoints**:

- [ ] Revenue growth maintaining 11-15% range
- [ ] Operating margin progression toward 29% target
- [ ] Competitive market share stable vs Disney+/Amazon
- [ ] Content engagement metrics and completion rates

### Exit Triggers

1. **Thesis Broken**: Subscriber growth turns negative in NA/Europe
2. **Valuation Target**: $1,150+ (limited upside remaining)
3. **Better Opportunity**: Required excess return: 15%+
4. **Risk Materialization**: Regulatory content restrictions in major markets

## üìã Analysis Metadata

**Data Sources & Quality**:

- Primary Sources: Netflix IR (0.95), SEC filings (0.90), Industry reports (0.80)
- Data Completeness: 88%
- Latest Data Point: Q4 2024 earnings (January 2025)

**Methodology Notes**:

- DCF assumes terminal growth of 4% and WACC of 8.5%
- P/E multiple compressed from current 56x to industry average 48x
- Content spending normalized as % of revenue vs absolute growth
- Regional ARPU weighted by subscriber base for global calculations

**Key Limitations**:

- Limited visibility into ad-tier monetization timeline
- Difficulty quantifying content ROI and effectiveness
- Regulatory environment rapidly evolving globally

---

**Investment Summary**: Netflix demonstrates strong operational execution with industry-leading engagement metrics and improving profitability. However, current valuation at 56x P/E appears disconnected from moderating growth prospects and intensifying competition. The company trades at a significant premium to intrinsic value with limited margin of safety. Recommend holding existing positions while seeking better entry opportunities below $850 or rotating to higher-conviction names with superior risk-adjusted returns. The streaming leader faces a maturing market requiring increased capital efficiency and differentiation to justify premium valuations.
