## Investment Recommendation Summary

Mettler-Toledo warrants a BUY rating at current levels despite near-term China headwinds, supported by exceptional business quality metrics and reasonable valuation. The company's verified market leadership in precision instruments (particularly laboratory balances), combined with 34% service revenue mix growing toward 40%+, provides earnings resilience through cycles. Strong free cash flow generation ($864M, 22.3% margin) and disciplined capital allocation (45.7% ROIC) underpin shareholder value creation. While Q1 2025 showed China weakness and tariff pressures creating near-term margin headwinds, the company maintains pricing power and cost discipline. With shares trading at $1,193.31 versus intrinsic value of $1,338 and street consensus of $1,253, risk-reward favors accumulation. The 55% probability base case projects 12.2% returns, while downside appears limited given net debt/EBITDA of only 1.58x and counter-cyclical laboratory demand. Position sizing of 3-5% reflects high conviction in business quality balanced with cyclical exposure. Key monitorables include China order trends, service revenue mix progression, and margin recovery trajectory as tariff mitigation efforts gain traction.
