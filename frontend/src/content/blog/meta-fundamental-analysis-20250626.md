The company's advertising moat remains formidable despite competitive pressures, with AI integration creating new monetization opportunities across its 3.43 billion daily active users. Q1 2025 results validated this thesis with 16% revenue growth to $42.3B, driven by AI tool adoption and Meta AI reaching 1B monthly active users.

- **Risk-Adjusted Return**: 10.2% (Sharpe: 1.3)
- **Position Size**: 3-5% of portfolio

## Investment Recommendation Summary

Meta Platforms presents a compelling investment opportunity trading at attractive valuation levels relative to its dominant market position and validated AI monetization momentum. Q1 2025 results demonstrate exceptional execution with 16% revenue growth to $42.3B, 37% EPS growth to $6.43, and critical AI milestone achievement of 1B Meta AI users. The company's advertising business maintains operational excellence with 39.3% operating margins while AI tool adoption accelerated 30% quarter-over-quarter, validating our core investment thesis. Reality Labs posted $4.2B losses but Ray-Ban Meta sales momentum indicates emerging product-market fit in smart glasses. The quantified analysis supports a 0.9 conviction BUY rating with 11-15% expected returns, backed by verified network effects moat (3.43B DAP), substantial free cash flow generation ($54B annualized), and multiple expansion opportunities through proven AI revenue integration. Key risks include Reality Labs continued losses exceeding $16B annually and regulatory compliance costs, though Meta's first-party data advantages and demonstrated AI monetization provide strong defensive positioning. The base case scenario anticipates sustained 14-16% revenue growth with expanding AI contribution, while upside potential exists through direct AI revenue streams and Reality Labs breakthrough products. Position sizing of 3-5% reflects balanced risk-reward dynamics with strong downside protection through 0.3% dividend yield and conservative 25x forward P/E valuation relative to verified growth trajectory.
