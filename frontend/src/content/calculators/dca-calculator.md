## Bitcoin DCA Strategy Calculator

Dollar-cost averaging (DCA) is a proven investment strategy where you invest a fixed amount regularly, regardless of price. This calculator helps you understand the potential returns of a Bitcoin DCA strategy.

### Why Dollar Cost Average?

- **Reduces Timing Risk**: No need to time the market perfectly
- **Disciplined Approach**: Automatic investing removes emotion
- **Averages Out Volatility**: Buy more when prices are low, less when high
- **Accessible**: Start with any amount you're comfortable with

### How to Use This Calculator

1. **Weekly Investment**: Enter your regular investment amount
2. **Time Period**: Select your investment start and end dates
3. **Price Inputs**: Provide current BTC price and average price during your period
4. **Calculate**: See your total returns and portfolio metrics

### Understanding Your Results

- **Total Invested**: Sum of all your weekly investments
- **BTC Accumulated**: Total Bitcoin acquired through DCA
- **Current Value**: Today's value of your Bitcoin holdings
- **Average Cost Basis**: Your average purchase price per Bitcoin
- **Annualized Return**: Your yearly return percentage

### Investment Considerations

This calculator provides estimates based on your inputs. Actual returns depend on real Bitcoin prices during your investment period. Past performance doesn't guarantee future results. Always invest responsibly and never invest more than you can afford to lose.
