# Command Collaboration Framework - Testing Strategy

## Core Responsibilities Analysis

### **1. Command Discovery & Registration (Foundation Layer)**
- **Scope Resolution**: User vs project command precedence
- **Registry Management**: Command catalog maintenance and updates
- **Manifest Processing**: Dependency and capability parsing
- **Path Resolution**: Multi-project command location handling

### **2. Dependency Resolution & Optimization (Core Value Layer)**
- **Dependency Discovery**: Finding required/optional command outputs
- **Context Enhancement**: Merging team data for improved execution
- **Cache Strategy**: Performance optimization through intelligent reuse
- **Missing Dependency Handling**: Graceful degradation when data unavailable

### **3. Team Workspace Management (Data Layer)**
- **Shared Context**: Project state and team knowledge maintenance
- **Output Storage**: Standardized metadata and file organization

## End-to-End Testing Scenarios

### **E2E Test 1: Full Collaboration Workflow**
```
Scenario: Complete team collaboration cycle
Given: Clean team workspace
When: Execute command sequence (code-owner â†’ product-owner â†’ architect)
Then: Each command enhances with previous outputs
And: Final output shows cumulative team intelligence
And: All metadata tracks complete lineage
```

### **E2E Test 2: Cross-Project Command Resolution**
```
Scenario: Multi-project command isolation and override
Given: User command 'analyzer' exists globally
And: Project-specific 'analyzer' exists in project-a
When: Execute 'analyzer' from project-a vs project-b
Then: Project-a uses project-specific version
And: Project-b uses user global version
And: No cross-contamination occurs
```

### **E2E Test 3: Performance Optimization Chain**
```
Scenario: Team collaboration performance gains
Given: Baseline execution time for isolated commands
When: Execute same commands with team collaboration enabled
Then: Execution time improves by expected percentages
And: Cache utilization metrics validate optimization
And: Team data reuse eliminates redundant processing
```

### **E2E Test 4: Framework Resilience**
```
Scenario: Robust operation under adverse conditions
Given: Partially corrupted team workspace
And: Missing dependency outputs
And: Invalid metadata files
When: Execute commands requiring team collaboration
Then: Commands degrade gracefully to isolated mode
And: Generate warnings but continue execution
And: Produce valid outputs with reduced enhancement
```

### **E2E Test 5: New Command Integration**
```
Scenario: Dynamic command ecosystem evolution
Given: Existing command ecosystem with collaboration
When: Add new command with dependencies on existing outputs
Then: Registry auto-updates with new command
And: Dependencies resolve correctly
And: Existing commands recognize new consumer
And: Workflow patterns adapt to include new command
```
