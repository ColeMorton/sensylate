## Document Template Standards

### Required Header Structure

```markdown
# [Command Name]: [Brief Description]

**Command Classification**: [ðŸŽ¯ Product/ðŸ“š Infrastructure]
**Knowledge Domain**: `[domain-name]`
**Framework**: [methodology/framework] ([acronym])
**Outputs To**: `./team-workspace/commands/[command-name]/outputs/`

[Command overview paragraph]

## MANDATORY: Pre-Execution Coordination

**CRITICAL**: Before any [command activities], integrate with Content Lifecycle Management system:

### Step 1: Pre-Execution Consultation
```bash
python team-workspace/coordination/pre-execution-consultation.py [command-name] [knowledge-domain] "{specific-scope}"
```

### Step 2: Handle Consultation Results
[Detailed consultation response handling]

### Step 3: Workspace Validation
```bash
python3 team-workspace/shared/validate-before-execution.py [command-name]
```

**Only proceed with [command activities] if consultation and validation are successful.**
```

### Required Metadata Fields

All command documents MUST include:

- **Command Classification**: Product (ðŸŽ¯) or Infrastructure (ðŸ“š)
