## Critical Business Decisions

### **IMMEDIATE: Yahoo Finance Integration Crisis Resolution**
**Priority**: P0 - CRITICAL
**Business Case**: Platform credibility at risk - data inconsistency could damage trading analysis reputation and user trust

**Current State Analysis**:
- **Technical Risk**: Multiple conflicting integration approaches without clear strategy
- **Business Impact**: Unreliable data = unreliable trading insights = user churn
- **Financial Risk**: Potential loss of competitive advantage in financial analysis market

**Success Criteria**:
- Single, reliable Yahoo Finance integration with <1% error rate
- Comprehensive error handling with user-friendly fallbacks
- Data consistency across all trading analysis outputs
- Zero regression in existing functionality

**Implementation Plan**:
- **Week 1**: Consolidate to single `YahooFinanceService` class
- **Week 2**: Implement proper error handling, validation, and testing
- **Confidence Level**: 90% (well-understood technical solution)

**Stakeholders**: Product users (trading analysis consumers), Engineering team
**Risk Mitigation**: Gradual rollout with feature flags and monitoring

### **IMMEDIATE: Security Configuration Hardening**
**Priority**: P0 - HIGH
**Business Case**: Prevent potential security incidents and regulatory compliance issues

**Current Vulnerabilities**:
- Sensitive configuration exposed in repository
- No secrets management system
- Trading analysis data in public directories

**Business Impact**:
- **Compliance Risk**: Potential regulatory violations in financial data handling
- **Reputation Risk**: Security incidents could damage platform credibility
- **Operational Risk**: API abuse or data theft

**Success Criteria**:
- All sensitive data moved to environment variables
