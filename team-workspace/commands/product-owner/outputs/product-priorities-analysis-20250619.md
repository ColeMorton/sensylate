- **Dependencies**: None - isolated system
- **Risk Mitigation**: Parallel operation during transition

### P0: IMMEDIATE - Security Configuration Exposure Fix
**Business Case**: Legal and compliance violation - sensitive data exposed in repository
- **Current State**: Contact emails, trading outputs visible in public repo
- **Risk**: Information disclosure, API abuse, regulatory compliance issues
- **Impact**: Legal liability, potential security breaches
- **Investment**: 1 week development effort
- **ROI**: Eliminate compliance risk, protect business reputation

**Success Criteria**:
- All sensitive configuration moved to environment variables
- `.env.example` created with required variables
- Public directories cleared of sensitive trading data
- Secrets management system operational

**Implementation Plan**:
- Days 1-2: Audit and identify all exposed sensitive data
- Days 3-4: Implement environment variable system
- Day 5: Update deployment documentation, validate security
- **Dependencies**: DevOps coordination for environment setup
- **Risk Mitigation**: Security audit checklist validation

### P1: HIGH - Typography System Unification
**Business Case**: Brand consistency and user experience - eliminate design system conflicts
- **Current State**: Dual typography systems creating inconsistent heading hierarchy
- **Impact**: Brand perception, content readability, developer frustration
- **Investment**: 2.5 days development effort
- **ROI**: Improved user experience, simplified CSS maintenance

**Success Criteria**:
- Consistent heading weights across all pages (H1:800, H2:700, H3:600)
- No CSS conflicts between base styles and prose plugin
- Elements page validation passes
- Zero regression in existing functionality

**Implementation Plan**:
- Day 1: Font weight configuration update, base CSS standardization
- Day 2: Remove prose conflicts, comprehensive testing
- Half-day: Cross-browser validation, documentation update
- **Dependencies**: None - isolated frontend changes
- **Risk Mitigation**: Visual regression testing, rollback procedures

### P2: STRATEGIC - MCP Server Integration Platform
**Business Case**: Operational transformation - modernize data pipeline for AI-native workflows
- **Current State**: 0% cache utilization, fragmented API management across 6 sources
- **Potential**: 60-80% operational overhead reduction, 50% faster analysis execution
