## 📋 Conclusion

The historical performance of 15 closed trades reveals a **marginally profitable system with significant optimization potential**. While the 53.33% win rate and 1.19 profit factor indicate a slight edge, the poor exit efficiency (57%) and lack of risk management present clear improvement opportunities.

**Key Takeaways:**
- **Consumer discretionary outperformance** (TSLA, LYV leading gains)
- **15-30 day optimal holding period** (71% win rate)
- **Quality setup importance** (100% win rate on "Excellent" trades)
- **Exit strategy urgently needed** (leaving 43% of profits on table)
