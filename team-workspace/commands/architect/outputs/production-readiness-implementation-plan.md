_Generated: June 20, 2025_
_Architect Framework: Research-Plan-Implement Pattern_

## Executive Summary

```xml
<summary>
  <objective>Transform Sensylate from sophisticated prototype into production-ready financial analysis platform</objective>
  <approach>Security-first deployment with performance optimization</approach>
  <value>Enable enterprise customer deployment, reduce security risks, improve user experience performance</value>
</summary>
```

## Architecture Design

### Current State Analysis
- **Multi-modal architecture**: Astro frontend + Python backend + AI collaboration framework
- **Security posture**: Basic protections with comprehensive code quality gates
- **Performance**: ~2-3MB bundle size, 571MB node_modules, unoptimized assets

### Target State Vision
- **Production security**: Zero critical vulnerabilities, secrets management, CSP headers
- **Optimized performance**: <1MB bundle, <2s load times, 50% asset reduction
- **Deployment ready**: Scalable, monitored, compliant platform
- **Preserved functionality**: All existing commands including Content Evaluator unchanged

### Transformation Path
Focus on infrastructure hardening and performance optimization while preserving all existing functionality, especially the working Content Evaluator command.
