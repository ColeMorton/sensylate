# Architect: Team-Workspace Content Lifecycle Management Implementation Plan

## Executive Summary

<summary>
  <objective>Implement a robust content lifecycle management system to eliminate duplication, contradiction, and disorder in team-workspace, improving collaboration effectiveness by ~40-50%</objective>
  <approach>Topic-centric reorganization with automated lifecycle management, single source of truth protocol, and pre-execution coordination engine</approach>
  <value>Eliminate 70% of duplicate analyses, reduce decision-making confusion, ensure temporal integrity, and establish sustainable knowledge management</value>
</summary>

## Current State Analysis

### Critical Issues Identified

**1. Temporal Confusion**: Files dated "December 19, 2024" generated in June 2025
**2. Status Contradictions**: Yahoo Finance described as both "fragmented/critical" and "consolidation complete"
**3. Redundant Health Assessments**: Multiple comprehensive analyses covering identical technical debt
**4. Cross-Command Duplication**: Same issues analyzed independently by different commands

### Documented Duplication Examples

- **Code-Owner Assessments**: 3 health assessments with contradictory conclusions
- **Product Strategy**: Sequential strategic decisions with conflicting priorities
- **Implementation Plans**: 909-line plans for already-completed work
- **Requirements Analysis**: Same projects analyzed by multiple commands independently

### Root Cause Analysis

**1. No Content Versioning**: Multiple analyses on same topics without proper superseding
**2. Command Silos**: Each command creates outputs independently without coordination
**3. No Lifecycle Management**: Old analyses accumulate without archival strategy
**4. Status Inconsistency**: Same projects reported as both complete and critical

## Architecture Design

### Current State Issues
- **No Content Versioning**: Multiple analyses on same topics without proper superseding
- **Command Silos**: Each command creates outputs independently without coordination
- **No Lifecycle Management**: Old analyses accumulate without archival strategy
- **Status Inconsistency**: Same projects reported as both complete and critical

### Target State Architecture

```xml
<requirements>
  <objective>Eliminate 70% of duplicate analyses and establish single source of truth for all team-workspace knowledge</objective>
  <constraints>Must preserve existing collaboration patterns and command independence while adding coordination layer</constraints>
  <success_criteria>Zero conflicting analyses, clear content freshness indicators, automated superseding workflow</success_criteria>
  <stakeholders>AI command team, development workflow, decision-making processes</stakeholders>
</requirements>
```

### Transformation Path

**Topic-Centric Knowledge Architecture**:
```

│   ├── product-strategy/         # All strategic decisions (versioned)
│   └── requirements/             # All requirements analysis (linked)
