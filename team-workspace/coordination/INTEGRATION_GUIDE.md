# Team-Workspace Content Lifecycle Management Integration Guide

## Overview

The Team-Workspace Content Lifecycle Management system provides comprehensive coordination tools to prevent duplicate analyses, establish clear content authority, and maintain knowledge freshness. This guide explains how AI commands can integrate with the system.

## Quick Start for AI Commands

Before creating any new analysis, run this simple consultation:

```bash
python team-workspace/coordination/pre-execution-consultation.py <command_name> <topic> "<scope_description>"
```

**Example:**
```bash
python team-workspace/coordination/pre-execution-consultation.py architect technical-health "comprehensive security analysis"
```

The system will tell you whether to proceed, coordinate, or reference existing work.

## Integration Points

### 1. Pre-Execution Consultation (Required)

**When:** Before starting any new analysis
**Purpose:** Prevent duplication and get coordination guidance

```python
# Example integration in command
from team_workspace.coordination.pre_execution_consultation import PreExecutionConsultant

consultant = PreExecutionConsultant()
result = consultant.consult_before_execution(
    command_name="architect",
    proposed_topic="technical-health",
    proposed_scope="security analysis"
)

if result["recommendation"] == "avoid_duplication":
    print(f"Existing work found: {result['existing_knowledge']['authority_path']}")
    # Reference existing work instead of duplicating
elif result["recommendation"] == "coordinate_required":
    print(f"Coordinate with: {result['ownership_status']['primary_owner']}")
    # Reach out for collaboration
else:
    # Proceed with analysis
    pass
```

### 2. Decision Tree Guidance (Recommended)

**When:** Need structured decision making
**Purpose:** Get detailed guidance on update vs. new analysis

```bash
python team-workspace/coordination/decision-tree.py <command> <topic> "<scope>" [--force-new]
```

### 3. Topic Ownership Management (As Needed)

**When:** Want to claim ownership or check ownership status
**Purpose:** Establish clear authority and collaboration permissions

```bash
# Check who owns a topic
python team-workspace/coordination/topic-ownership-manager.py ownership <topic>

# Claim ownership of unowned topic
python team-workspace/coordination/topic-ownership-manager.py claim <topic> <command> "justification"

# Get collaboration suggestions
python team-workspace/coordination/topic-ownership-manager.py collaborate <command> <topic>
```

### 4. Superseding Workflow (When Replacing Content)

**When:** Creating new analysis that replaces existing content
**Purpose:** Proper archival and audit trail

```bash
python team-workspace/coordination/superseding-workflow.py declare <command> <topic> <new_file> <old_files> "reason"
```

## Content Lifecycle States

### New Analysis
1. **Consult** → Check for existing knowledge
2. **Claim** → Establish ownership if unowned
3. **Create** → Build analysis in `knowledge/` structure
4. **Register** → Update topic registry

### Update Existing
1. **Consult** → Confirm update is needed
2. **Coordinate** → Work with owner if you're not primary
3. **Supersede** → Declare superseding intent
4. **Update** → Modify authoritative content
5. **Archive** → Archive superseded versions

### Reference Existing
1. **Consult** → Confirms fresh content exists
2. **Reference** → Link to authoritative source
3. **Coordinate** → Contact owner if additional analysis needed

## Knowledge Structure

### Authority Locations
```
team-workspace/knowledge/
├── technical-health/           # Code quality, security, performance
├── implementation-plans/       # Architect implementation plans
├── product-strategy/          # Product decisions and priorities
└── requirements/              # Business analysis and requirements
```

### Archive Structure
```
team-workspace/archive/
└── YYYY-MM-DD/               # Date of archival
    └── command/              # Command that performed archival
        └── topic/            # Topic being archived
            └── event_id/     # Specific superseding event
```

## Command-Specific Guidelines

### Architect
- **Primary Topics:** Implementation plans, technical architecture
- **Coordination:** Always check for existing plans before creating new ones
- **Superseding:** Use explicit superseding workflow for plan updates

### Code-Owner
- **Primary Topics:** Technical health assessments
- **Coordination:** Own health assessments, coordinate with product-owner on priorities
- **Updates:** Update health assessments when significant changes occur

### Product-Owner
- **Primary Topics:** Strategic product decisions
- **Coordination:** Reference technical assessments from code-owner
- **Frequency:** Update strategic decisions as business priorities change

### Business-Analyst
- **Primary Topics:** Requirements analysis, business case analysis
- **Coordination:** Work with product-owner on strategic alignment
- **Scope:** Focus on business requirements and process analysis

## Common Integration Patterns

### Pattern 1: Extending Existing Analysis
```bash
# 1. Check current state
python coordination/pre-execution-consultation.py architect technical-health "security deep-dive"

# 2. If response is "update_existing"
python coordination/superseding-workflow.py declare architect technical-health new_analysis.md existing_analysis.md "Added security analysis"

# 3. Create enhanced analysis
# 4. Update topic registry
```

### Pattern 2: Cross-Command Collaboration
```bash
# 1. Check ownership
python coordination/topic-ownership-manager.py ownership technical-health

# 2. If not owner, get collaboration guidance
python coordination/topic-ownership-manager.py collaborate architect technical-health

# 3. Coordinate with primary owner
# 4. Consider requesting secondary ownership
```

### Pattern 3: New Topic Creation
```bash
# 1. Check for related topics
python coordination/pre-execution-consultation.py business-analyst user-research "customer feedback analysis"

# 2. If no conflicts, claim ownership
python coordination/topic-ownership-manager.py claim user-research business-analyst "New business analysis area"

# 3. Create analysis in knowledge structure
# 4. Register in topic registry
```

## Error Handling

### Common Issues and Solutions

**"Topic already has fresh analysis"**
- Solution: Reference existing work or coordinate with owner for updates

**"You lack ownership permission"**
- Solution: Request secondary ownership or collaborate with primary owner

**"Authority file missing"**
- Solution: Check file paths in topic registry, restore from archive if needed

**"Conflicts detected"**
- Solution: Run conflict detection to identify and resolve contradictions

## Validation and Health Monitoring

### Regular Health Checks
```bash
# Overall system health
python coordination/knowledge-dashboard.py health

# Topic-specific validation
python coordination/knowledge-dashboard.py topic technical-health

# Detect ownership conflicts
python coordination/topic-ownership-manager.py conflicts
```

### Dashboard Monitoring
```bash
# Text dashboard
python coordination/knowledge-dashboard.py

# Markdown for documentation
python coordination/knowledge-dashboard.py markdown

# JSON for programmatic access
python coordination/knowledge-dashboard.py json
```

## Best Practices

### DO
- ✅ Always consult before creating new analysis
- ✅ Use explicit superseding for content replacement
- ✅ Maintain single authoritative source per topic
- ✅ Update topic registry when making changes
- ✅ Archive superseded content with metadata
- ✅ Coordinate with topic owners for major changes

### DON'T
- ❌ Create duplicate analysis without consultation
- ❌ Modify content you don't own without coordination
- ❌ Delete content without proper archival
- ❌ Ignore ownership boundaries
- ❌ Create analysis without establishing topic ownership
- ❌ Skip superseding workflow when replacing content

## Support and Troubleshooting

### Getting Help
- Run `python coordination/<tool>.py --help` for usage information
- Check `team-workspace/coordination/topic-registry.yaml` for current state
- Review `team-workspace/coordination/superseding-log.yaml` for audit trail

### Recovery Procedures
- **Content Recovery:** Use archive metadata for restoration instructions
- **Ownership Issues:** Use topic ownership manager to reassign or claim
- **Registry Corruption:** Restore from git history or rebuild from knowledge structure

## Implementation Status
