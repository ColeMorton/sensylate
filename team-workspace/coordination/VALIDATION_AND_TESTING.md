time python coordination/knowledge-dashboard.py
time python coordination/conflict-detection.py

# Load testing (simulate multiple commands)
for i in {1..5}; do
  python coordination/pre-execution-consultation.py "command$i" "topic$i" "scope$i" &
done
wait

# Memory usage monitoring
python -c "

## Data Integrity Validation

### Registry Consistency Checks

```bash
# Validate registry structure
python -c "
import yaml
import sys

try:
    with open('team-workspace/coordination/topic-registry.yaml') as f:
        registry = yaml.safe_load(f)

    required_sections = ['topics', 'command_ownership']
    for section in required_sections:
        if section not in registry:
            print(f'ERROR: Missing section {section}')
            sys.exit(1)

    print('✅ Registry structure valid')

    # Check topic consistency
    topics = registry['topics']
    ownership = registry['command_ownership']

    for topic_name, topic_data in topics.items():
        owner = topic_data.get('owner_command')
        if not owner:
            print(f'WARNING: Topic {topic_name} has no owner')
            continue

        # Check if owner exists in ownership map
        if owner not in ownership:
            print(f'ERROR: Owner {owner} not in ownership map')
            continue

        # Check if topic is in owner's topics
        owner_topics = ownership[owner].get('primary_topics', [])
        if topic_name not in owner_topics:
            print(f'ERROR: Topic {topic_name} not in {owner} primary topics')
            continue

    print('✅ Topic ownership consistency valid')

except Exception as e:
    print(f'ERROR: Registry validation failed: {e}')
    sys.exit(1)
"
```

### File System Consistency Checks

```bash
# Check authority file existence
python -c "
import yaml
from pathlib import Path

with open('team-workspace/coordination/topic-registry.yaml') as f:
    registry = yaml.safe_load(f)

missing_files = []
for topic_name, topic_data in registry['topics'].items():
    authority_path = topic_data.get('current_authority')
    if authority_path:
        if not Path(authority_path).exists():
            missing_files.append((topic_name, authority_path))

if missing_files:
    print('❌ Missing authority files:')
    for topic, path in missing_files:
        print(f'  {topic}: {path}')
else:
    print('✅ All authority files exist')
"
```

### Archive Integrity Checks

```bash
# Validate archive structure and metadata
python -c "
import yaml
from pathlib import Path

superseding_log_path = Path('team-workspace/coordination/superseding-log.yaml')
if superseding_log_path.exists():
    with open(superseding_log_path) as f:
        log = yaml.safe_load(f)

    events = log.get('superseding_events', [])
    archive_issues = []

    for event in events:
        if event.get('event_type') == 'superseding_completed':
            archived_files = event.get('archived_files', [])
            for archived_file in archived_files:
                archive_path = archived_file.get('archive_path')
                if archive_path and not Path(archive_path).exists():
                    archive_issues.append(archive_path)

    if archive_issues:
        print('❌ Missing archived files:')
        for path in archive_issues:
            print(f'  {path}')
    else:
        print('✅ Archive integrity maintained')
else:
    print('⚠️  No superseding log found')
