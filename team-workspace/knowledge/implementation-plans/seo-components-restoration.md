**Status**: Active
**Type**: Implementation Plan

## Overview

This is the authoritative implementation plan for restoring missing SEO components (WebVitals, EnhancedMeta, ReadingTime) that were commented out due to build failures.

## Implementation Phases

### Phase 1: WebVitals Component (2 days)
- Implement Core Web Vitals monitoring
- Create development UI indicator
- Add production analytics beacon
- Restore window.webVitalsMonitor API

### Phase 2: EnhancedMeta Component (1 day)
- Article-specific meta tags
- Trading symbols metadata
- SEO score integration
- Content analysis metadata

### Phase 3: ReadingTime Component (0.5 days)
- Reading time estimation display
- Multiple display variants
- Reading progress tracking

## Current Status

**Status**: âœ… COMPLETED - All 3 phases implemented successfully
**Implementation**: All components restored and fully functional
**Deployment**: Ready for production, committed to staging branch
