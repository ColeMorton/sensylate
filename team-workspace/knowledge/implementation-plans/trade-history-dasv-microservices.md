# Trade History DASV Microservices Implementation Plan

**Authority**: architect
**Topic**: trade-history-dasv-microservices
**Status**: Authoritative Implementation Plan
**Created**: July 1, 2025

## Authority Reference

This is the authoritative implementation plan for converting the trade_history.md command into DASV microservices architecture.

**Full Implementation Plan Location**: `/team-workspace/commands/architect/outputs/trade-history-dasv-microservices-plan.md`

## Executive Summary

Comprehensive plan to decompose the monolithic trade_history.md command into 4 specialized DASV microservices:

1. **trade_history_discover** - Data acquisition and market context gathering
2. **trade_history_analyze** - Statistical analysis and performance measurement
3. **trade_history_synthesize** - Report generation (Internal, Live, Historical)
4. **trade_history_validate** - Quality assurance and confidence verification

Plus **trade_history_full** orchestrator for complete workflow execution.

## Key Benefits

- **20% Performance Improvement** through optimized caching and parallel execution
- **Enhanced Maintainability** via modular microservices architecture
- **Future Extensibility** for easy addition of new analysis capabilities
- **Operational Excellence** with improved debugging and error handling

## Implementation Schedule

- **Total Duration**: 15 days
- **5 Phases**: Each microservice + orchestrator integration
- **Risk Mitigation**: Comprehensive rollback strategies at each phase
- **Testing**: Parallel operation with legacy command during transition

## Success Criteria

- Maintain 100% functional compatibility with existing outputs
- Achieve â‰¥15% performance improvement (target: 20%)
- Enable independent microservice execution
- Ensure seamless user experience transition
