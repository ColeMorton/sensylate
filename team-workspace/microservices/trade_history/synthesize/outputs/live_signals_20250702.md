## 游꿢 Signals to Watch

### High Priority Monitoring

#### **Portfolio Capacity Management**
- **Current Status**: 20/20 positions (100% capacity)
- **Implication**: New signals blocked until exits occur
- **Action**: Prioritize exit discipline for underperforming positions

#### **Technology Sector Concentration**
- **Exposure**: 9 technology positions (45% of portfolio)
- **Risk**: Sector-specific downturn could impact multiple positions
- **Monitor**: Relative sector performance vs broader market

#### **Duration Analysis**
- **Long-term Holdings**: 8 positions >45 days
- **Risk**: Extended holds may indicate exit timing inefficiency

### Strategic Considerations

#### **Exit Efficiency Optimization**
- **Current Challenge**: Analysis shows -90.81% exit efficiency
- **Opportunity**: Implement trailing stops or time-based exits
- **Impact**: Could improve overall performance by 15-25%

#### **Signal Generation Pipeline**
- **Recent Frequency**: 6 days since last signal (normal range)
- **Capacity Constraint**: Must exit positions to generate new signals
- **Priority**: Maintain active signal generation through disciplined exits

**Key Actions Required:**
1. **Monitor PGR closely** - approaching critical -10% stop level
2. **Review technology concentration** - 45% sector exposure
3. **Prepare for exits** - portfolio at capacity, need room for new signals
4. **Implement exit efficiency improvements** - trailing stops consideration
