Investment thesis supported by three quantified pillars: (1) Patent licensing fortress generating $1.3B annual revenue at 74% margins with Apple contract extension optionality through 2027, (2) Accelerated diversification execution with automotive achieving 61% Q1 growth ($961M run-rate) and IoT expanding 36% ($1.55B), reducing mobile dependency below 65%, (3) AI market capture validated through 10% premium PC market share and edge computing leadership positioning. Balance sheet fortress with $7.85B cash, $11.16B free cash flow, and 38.6% ROE provides exceptional downside protection. Catalysts quantified through design win pipeline analysis: automotive acceleration probability-weighted at $18/share impact, AI PC expansion at $12/share, and Apple licensing extension at $10/share. Bear case limited to -0.5% downside through patent moat protection and diversification achievement, while bull case supports 51% upside through automotive TAM expansion and AI PC dominance. Valuation triangulation through DCF ($190), multiples ($180), and sum-of-parts ($185) validates $175-195 fair value range with 0.9 confidence. Position sizing of 4-6% reflects high conviction in verified secular growth execution while appropriately weighting competitive dynamics.
