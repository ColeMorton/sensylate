- Credit loss assumptions based on stress test scenarios
- Terminal growth rate conservative at 2.5% reflecting mature market dynamics

**Investment Recommendation Summary**:
Zions Bancorporation presents an attractive investment opportunity at current valuations, trading at 9.8x forward earnings and 1.15x tangible book value. The bank's strong market positions in high-growth western markets, improving operational efficiency, and robust capital adequacy provide defensive characteristics while offering upside potential. Q1 2025 results demonstrated resilience with 18% earnings growth and net interest margin expansion of 16 basis points. The key risk factor remains commercial real estate exposure at 18.2% of loans, elevated compared to regional peers but actively managed through conservative underwriting standards. The base case scenario projects 12% upside to $56 per share, supported by gradual net interest margin recovery, stable credit quality, and continued operational improvements. Risk-adjusted returns of 10.2% with a Sharpe ratio of 0.9 support a BUY recommendation with 2-4% portfolio weighting. Catalysts include deposit cost normalization, commercial real estate market stabilization, and potential rate environment stabilization. The investment thesis centers on ZION's defensive regional banking franchise trading at attractive valuations with multiple paths to value creation over the next 12-18 months.
