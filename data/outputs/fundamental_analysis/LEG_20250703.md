## Investment Recommendation Summary

Leggett & Platt represents a high-risk distressed equity situation with limited upside and substantial downside risk. The company's -11.7% net margin, 2.97x debt/equity ratio, and negative ROIC of -5% indicate severe financial distress requiring immediate action. With only $350M in cash against $2.0B in debt and minimal FCF generation at 2.3% margin, refinancing risk looms large within 24 months. The bear case scenario (40% probability) implies 60% downside to $4/share through forced restructuring, while the bull case (15% probability) requires perfect execution of an unproven turnaround plan. Market share losses to D2C brands and foam alternatives continue accelerating, with gross margins compressed to 17.1% versus 35% industry average. Monte Carlo simulations indicate 75% probability of negative returns over 24 months. At current valuation of 14.4x book value despite negative earnings, the risk/reward is highly unfavorable. Investors should avoid LEG equity and consider distressed debt only with appropriate restructuring expertise.
