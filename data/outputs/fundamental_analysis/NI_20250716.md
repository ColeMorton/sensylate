# NI - NiSource Inc. Fundamental Analysis

## Executive Summary

NiSource Inc. (NI) is the largest regulated gas utility in its peer group with a market capitalization of $18.8B, operating natural gas distribution to ~3.3 million customers and electric generation/transmission to ~483,000 customers across six Midwest states. The company trades at a premium valuation (P/E of 21.55 vs peer average of 17.5) reflecting strong regulatory relationships and above-average rate base growth prospects of 6-8% annually. While the defensive utility offers predictable cash flows and a 2.73% dividend yield, persistent negative free cash flow through 2027 due to a $2.6B annual infrastructure investment program limits near-term appreciation potential. With the stock near 52-week highs and a restrictive interest rate environment creating financing headwinds, we assign a HOLD rating with a 12-month price target of $40.50.

- **Risk-Averse Investors**: Low beta provides portfolio stability
- **Growth Investors**: Better opportunities elsewhere given modest growth

## Key Takeaways

1. **Market Leader**: Largest regulated gas utility with stable, predictable cash flows
2. **Premium Valuation**: Trading at 23% P/E premium to peers reflects quality
3. **Capital Cycle**: Negative FCF through 2027 due to infrastructure investments
4. **Energy Transition**: Well-positioned with renewable generation investments
