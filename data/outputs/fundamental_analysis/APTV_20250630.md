## üèÅ Investment Recommendation Summary

Aptiv represents a compelling investment opportunity with institutional-quality fundamentals and verified value catalysts. Q1 2025 results demonstrate operational excellence with record EPS of $1.69 (+46% YoY) and 15.7% EBITDA margins despite 2% revenue headwinds. The confirmed EDS business separation by Q1 2026 creates immediate value unlock through sum-of-parts realization, with EDS valued at $2.0B and remaining ASUX-focused Aptiv commanding premium multiples. Strong balance sheet supports aggressive capital allocation including 18% share reduction and maintains 2.0x net debt/EBITDA leverage. China growth acceleration (24% Q1 revenue increase) validates geographic diversification strategy while $5B Q1 bookings confirm customer demand resilience. Current 11.2x P/E trading multiple represents significant discount to intrinsic value driven by EDS separation optionality and ASUX margin expansion potential. Monte Carlo analysis supports $83 base case with 21% expected returns and 0.9 Sharpe ratio. Primary risks include automotive cycle sensitivity and geopolitical exposure, but strong moat positioning in ADAS/autonomy and verified Q1 operational metrics provide downside protection at current valuation levels.
