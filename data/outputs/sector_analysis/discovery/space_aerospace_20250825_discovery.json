    "sector_overview": "The Space/Aerospace sector represents a $350+ billion global market with projected growth to $1+ trillion by 2040. Led by traditional aerospace/defense giants (Boeing, Lockheed Martin, RTX, Northrop Grumman) and emerging space technology companies (Rocket Lab, Planet Labs, Virgin Galactic). Sector benefits from dual government/commercial demand drivers including NASA's $25.4 billion 2025 budget, defense spending growth (7%+ YoY), and commercial space market expansion.",
    "sector_market_data": "Total addressable market capitalization of publicly traded space/aerospace companies exceeds $500 billion. RTX leads with $209.1B market cap, followed by Boeing ($174.0B), Lockheed Martin ($104.1B), and Northrop Grumman ($84.8B). Emerging companies show high growth: Rocket Lab up 800%+ over 12 months to $21.4B market cap. Traditional companies face mixed performance with Boeing recovering 55.71% over 12 months despite ongoing challenges.",
    "competitive_landscape": "Sector exhibits strong competitive moats through high barriers to entry, extensive regulatory requirements, and long product development cycles. Traditional aerospace/defense primes maintain dominant positions in government contracts while facing increasing competition from agile space technology companies. SpaceX (private, $350B valuation) disrupts launch services while companies like Rocket Lab target small satellite market. Consolidation continues with Maxar acquired by Advent International, Astra taken private.",
    "sector_etf_analysis": "Space-focused ETFs show mixed performance: ARKX trading at $26.58 (gained ~8% over past 2 weeks), UFO at $28.27 with $80M AUM, ROKT at $39.91 with 42.95% annual return. ARKX emphasizes technology integration (AI, robotics, 3D printing), UFO focuses on pure-play space companies, ROKT includes aerospace/defense with deep sea exploration exposure. All three ETFs benefit from growing institutional and retail investor interest in space economy themes.",
    "data_validation": "Multi-source data validation achieved through systematic cross-referencing of financial metrics, market capitalizations, and business intelligence across Yahoo Finance, financial news sources, company investor relations, and ETF prospectuses. All price data validated within trading session accuracy standards.",
