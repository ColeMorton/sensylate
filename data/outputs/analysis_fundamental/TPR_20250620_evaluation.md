**Current Stock Price**: Document shows $84.24 ✓ **Yahoo Finance**: $84.24 (Exact match)
**Market Cap**: Document shows $17.5B ✓ **Yahoo Finance**: $17.5B (Exact match)
**P/E Ratio**: Document shows 22.2x ✓ **Yahoo Finance**: 22.17x (0.1% variance)
**Dividend Yield**: Document shows 1.66% ✓ **Yahoo Finance**: 1.66% (Exact match)
**2024 Revenue**: Document shows $6.67B ✓ **Yahoo Finance**: $6.671B (0.02% variance)
**2024 Net Income**: Document shows $816M ✓ **Yahoo Finance**: $816M (Exact match)
**2024 Operating Margin**: Document calculation 23.1% ✓ **Calculated**: ($1,140M/$6,671M) = 17.1% ❌ **Significant Error**

### ⚠️ Questionable Claims (Medium Confidence)
**ROE Calculation**: Document shows 39.8% - appears inflated given equity base
**Free Cash Flow**: Document shows $1.15B vs calculated $1.147B from Yahoo data (0.3% variance - acceptable)
**Net Debt**: Document shows $1.1B ✓ **Yahoo Finance**: $1.099B (0.1% variance)
**Working Capital**: Document shows $7.1B ✓ **Yahoo Finance**: $7.092B (0.1% variance)

### ❌ Inaccurate Claims (Low Confidence)
**Operating Margin Calculation Error**: Document claims 23.1% operating margin, but Yahoo Finance data shows Operating Income of $1,140M on Revenue of $6,671M = 17.1% operating margin. This is a **significant 6 percentage point error** that impacts valuation assumptions.

### ❓ Unverifiable Claims
**Coach Brand Revenue Growth**: 6.0% - specific brand-level data not available in Yahoo Finance
**Digital Penetration**: 27% - company-specific metric requiring earnings call verification
**Customer Acquisition**: 2.7M new customers in North America - requires company disclosure verification
**China Market Revenue**: $902M current, targeting $1.3B by 2034 - forward-looking projection

## Decision Impact Assessment
**Thesis-Breaking Issues**: None identified - core investment thesis remains valid despite calculation errors
**Material Concerns**:
1. Operating margin miscalculation (23.1% vs actual 17.1%) inflates profitability assumptions
2. This error may impact DCF valuation by $8-12 per share
3. ROE calculation appears optimistic and needs verification

**Refinement Needed**:
1. Correct operating margin calculations throughout analysis
2. Verify ROE calculation methodology
3. Cross-reference brand-specific metrics with latest earnings calls

## Usage Recommendations
- **Safe for Decision-Making**: Yes, with corrections to margin calculations
- **Required Corrections**:
  1. **CRITICAL**: Recalculate operating margin using verified financial data (17.1% not 23.1%)
  2. **HIGH**: Verify ROE calculation methodology and assumptions
  3. **MEDIUM**: Validate brand-specific growth metrics against latest company disclosures
- **Follow-up Research**:
  1. Review latest TPR earnings call for brand-level performance metrics
  2. Verify competitive positioning claims against industry reports
  3. Cross-check DCF assumptions with corrected margin data
- **Monitoring Requirements**:
  1. Track actual vs projected operating margins quarterly
  2. Monitor China market recovery progress
  3. Validate digital transformation progress against 33% target
