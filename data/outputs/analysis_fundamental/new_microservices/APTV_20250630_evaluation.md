  3. **MEDIUM**: Cross-reference valuation against broader analyst consensus beyond single target
- **Follow-up Research**:
  1. Validate ADAS bookings data through OEM customer disclosures
  2. Research EDS spinoff precedents for valuation impact methodology
  3. Analyze China regulatory environment affecting market penetration feasibility
