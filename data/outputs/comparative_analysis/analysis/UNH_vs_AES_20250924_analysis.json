      "summary_statement": "UNH represents a superior risk-adjusted investment opportunity with decisive advantages across financial health, competitive positioning, business model quality, and return potential. The combination of defensive healthcare characteristics, demographic tailwinds, technology platform differentiation, and attractive valuation creates a compelling investment thesis suitable for core portfolio allocation.",
      "comparative_conclusion": "While AES offers attractive dividend yield and value characteristics, the elevated leverage risk, earnings volatility, and limited growth potential make it suitable only for specialized income-focused allocations. UNH's comprehensive superiority across all analytical dimensions makes it the clear winner for most investment scenarios and portfolio construction approaches."
