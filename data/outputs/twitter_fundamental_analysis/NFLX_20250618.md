üéØ $NFLX trading at $1,222 but our analysis shows fair value of $850-$1,050

The math is simple:
‚Ä¢ DCF: $865 (7.5/10 confidence)
‚Ä¢ P/E Multiple: $1,025 (8.0/10 confidence)
‚Ä¢ EV/EBITDA: $950 (7.8/10 confidence)

Weighted fair value: $925

Key assumption: 12% FCF growth vs 56x P/E premium

üìä The problem? $NFLX trades at 56x P/E while subscriber growth is decelerating

Strong fundamentals:
‚Ä¢ 301.6M subscribers (record growth)
‚Ä¢ 22.2% operating margin
‚Ä¢ $6.9B free cash flow
‚Ä¢ 2.3% churn (best-in-class)

But valuation assumes perfection at current levels

üîç 3 catalysts could bridge the gap:

1. Ad-tier monetization - 75% likely = +$50/share
2. Password crackdown revenue - 85% likely = +$35/share
3. Content cost optimization - 65% likely = +$25/share

Target entry: Below $850 (8% margin of safety)
