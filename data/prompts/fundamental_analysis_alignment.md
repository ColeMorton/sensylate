Think harder. I have tested the execution of the new microservices implementation of fundamental_analyst. Each command was executed sequentially and individually for complete DASV workflow.                                                   │

│   1: deeply examine the files referenced and the specification for the microservices: @docs/ai-command-microservices-specification.md.                                                                                                            │
│   2: Assess the the function and output of the new microservices feature through deep comparison and understand where it does, and where it doesn't meet expectations.                                                                            │
