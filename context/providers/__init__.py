"""
Context Providers for Sensylate

This module contains specialized context providers that handle different aspects
of the command execution environment. Each provider encapsulates the complexity
of a specific domain while exposing a clean interface for commands.

Providers follow the principle of treating context as a first-class architectural
concern, enabling commands to remain pure functions while contexts handle all
environmental dependencies.

Available Providers:
- MCPContextProvider: Unified MCP server access and management
- DataContextProvider: File operations and data management
- ValidationContextProvider: Data quality and validation rules
