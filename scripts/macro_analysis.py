Macro-Economic Analysis - DASV Phase 2 Implementation

Performs comprehensive macro-economic template gap analysis following macro_analysis:analyze command requirements:
- Advanced business cycle modeling with multi-dimensional phase identification
- Global liquidity and monetary policy transmission analysis
- Market regime classification and cross-asset correlation framework
- Economic scenario analysis with probability-weighted forecasting
- Quantified macro-economic risk assessment matrices
- Cross-asset transmission mechanism analysis
- Integrated macroeconomic risk scoring with multi-indicator framework
- Economic policy assessment and outlook framework

Key Requirements:
- Fill analytical gaps required by macro_analysis_template.md that are missing from discovery
- Focus exclusively on template gap analysis - no data duplication from discovery
- Business cycle modeling with NBER-style recession probability calculation
- Comprehensive liquidity environment assessment with central bank coordination
- Market regime classification with volatility environment analysis
- Economic scenario analysis with base/bull/bear case probability weighting
- Quantified risk matrices with probability/impact scoring across economic variables
- Cross-asset transmission analysis with rate, currency, and risk asset dynamics
- Multi-indicator macroeconomic risk composite scoring
- Investment recommendation gap analysis for synthesis preparation

Usage:
    python scripts/macro_analysis.py --discovery-file ./data/outputs/macro_analysis/discovery/US_20250804_discovery.json
