# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

Sensylate is a multi-modal platform combining **Python data processing**, **Astro frontend**, and **AI command collaboration**. The system specializes in trading strategy analysis, content generation, and automated workflow orchestration.

### Core Components

**Frontend** (content management) located in the `frontend/` directory:

- **Astro 5.7+** as the main framework
- **TailwindCSS 4+** for styling
- **TypeScript** for type safety
- **React** for interactive components
- **MDX** for content authoring

## Development Commands

All commands should be run from the `frontend/` directory:

```bash
# Install dependencies
yarn install

# Start development server (generates JSON config first)
yarn dev

# Build for production (generates JSON config first)
yarn build

# Preview production build
yarn preview

# Type checking
yarn check

# Format code with Prettier
yarn format

# Generate JSON configuration files
yarn generate-json

# Remove dark mode and format
yarn remove-darkmode

# Testing
yarn test                # Run tests once
yarn test:watch          # Run tests in watch mode
yarn test:coverage       # Run tests with coverage report

# Code Quality
yarn lint                # Run ESLint and auto-fix issues
yarn lint:check          # Run ESLint without fixing
yarn check-git-tracking  # Check for untracked files being imported (prevents build failures)
yarn pre-commit          # Run all pre-commit checks manually

# Python Development (from root directory)
make format              # Format Python code with black and isort
make lint                # Run flake8 linting and black check
make test                # Run Python tests
python3 -m mypy scripts/ # Type checking for Python code

# Pre-commit Quality Enforcement
pre-commit run --all-files  # Run all quality checks on entire codebase
pre-commit install          # Install git hooks (already done)
pre-commit uninstall        # Remove git hooks if needed
```

## Quality Standards

This project enforces comprehensive code quality standards through automated pre-commit hooks:

**Python Quality Gates (scripts/ directory)**:
- **black**: Automatic code formatting (88-character line length)
- **isort**: Import statement sorting and organization
- **flake8**: Code linting and style checking
- **mypy**: Static type checking with import validation
- **bandit**: Security vulnerability scanning

**TypeScript/Frontend Quality Gates (frontend/ directory)**:
- **prettier**: Code formatting with Astro and TailwindCSS plugins
- **eslint**: Linting with React, TypeScript, and Astro rules

**General Quality Enforcement**:
- Trailing whitespace removal
- Consistent file endings
- YAML/JSON syntax validation
- Large file prevention
- Merge conflict detection

All quality checks run automatically on every commit. Failed checks prevent commits from proceeding.

# â†’ Creates engaging, data-driven social media content
```

**Note**: These are custom workflow commands with AI collaboration capabilities. Commands automatically share context and data through the team workspace for enhanced results.

## Content Lifecycle Management Integration

All AI commands **MUST** integrate with the Content Lifecycle Management system to prevent duplication and maintain knowledge integrity:

**Mandatory Pre-execution Requirements**: All commands must complete both workspace validation and content consultation before execution.

### Before Creating Any Analysis

**Required**: Run pre-execution consultation before starting new analysis:

```bash
python team-workspace/coordination/pre-execution-consultation.py <command_name> <topic> "<scope>"
```

**Example**:
```bash
python team-workspace/coordination/pre-execution-consultation.py architect technical-health "comprehensive security analysis"
```

### Integration Workflow

1. **Consult**: Check for existing knowledge and get coordination guidance
2. **Decide**: Use decision tree for structured update-vs-new analysis decisions
3. **Coordinate**: Work with topic owners when necessary
4. **Execute**: Create or update content following system guidance
5. **Supersede**: Use proper superseding workflow when replacing existing content

### Quick Commands

```bash
# Check topic ownership
python team-workspace/coordination/topic-ownership-manager.py ownership <topic>

# Get collaboration guidance
python team-workspace/coordination/decision-tree.py <command> <topic> "<scope>"

# Monitor system health
python team-workspace/coordination/knowledge-dashboard.py

# Declare content superseding
python team-workspace/coordination/superseding-workflow.py declare <command> <topic> <new_file> <old_files> "reason"
```

### Knowledge Structure

All authoritative content is organized in topic-centric structure:

```
team-workspace/knowledge/
â”œâ”€â”€ technical-health/          # Technical assessments (owner: code-owner)
â”œâ”€â”€ implementation-plans/      # Implementation plans (owner: architect)
â”œâ”€â”€ product-strategy/         # Product decisions (owner: product-owner)
â””â”€â”€ requirements/             # Requirements analysis (owner: business-analyst)
```

### Content Authority Rules

- **Single Source of Truth**: Each topic has one authoritative file in `knowledge/`
- **Proper Superseding**: Use superseding workflow when replacing content
- **Archive Preservation**: Superseded content archived with full recovery metadata
- **Ownership Respect**: Coordinate with topic owners before making changes

**Failure to integrate with lifecycle management will result in content conflicts and degraded team-workspace effectiveness.**

### Command Output Location Standards
