# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

Sensylate is a multi-modal platform combining **Python data processing**, **Astro frontend**, and **AI command collaboration**. The system specializes in trading strategy analysis, content generation, and automated workflow orchestration.

### Core Components

**Frontend** (content management) located in the `frontend/` directory:

- **Astro 5.7+** as the main framework
- **TailwindCSS 4+** for styling
- **TypeScript** for type safety
- **React** for interactive components
- **MDX** for content authoring

## Development Commands

All commands should be run from the `frontend/` directory:

```bash
# Install dependencies
yarn install

# Start development server (generates JSON config first)
yarn dev

# Build for production (generates JSON config first)
yarn build

# Preview production build
yarn preview

# Type checking
yarn check

# Format code with Prettier
yarn format

# Generate JSON configuration files
yarn generate-json

# Remove dark mode and format
yarn remove-darkmode

# Testing
yarn test                # Run tests once
yarn test:watch          # Run tests in watch mode
yarn test:coverage       # Run tests with coverage report

# Code Quality
yarn lint                # Run ESLint and auto-fix issues
yarn lint:check          # Run ESLint without fixing
yarn pre-commit          # Run all pre-commit checks manually

# Python Development (from root directory)
make format              # Format Python code with black and isort
make lint                # Run flake8 linting and black check
make test                # Run Python tests
python3 -m mypy scripts/ # Type checking for Python code

# Pre-commit Quality Enforcement
pre-commit run --all-files  # Run all quality checks on entire codebase
pre-commit install          # Install git hooks (already done)
pre-commit uninstall        # Remove git hooks if needed
```

## Quality Standards

This project enforces comprehensive code quality standards through automated pre-commit hooks:

**Python Quality Gates (scripts/ directory)**:
- **black**: Automatic code formatting (88-character line length)
- **isort**: Import statement sorting and organization
- **flake8**: Code linting and style checking
- **mypy**: Static type checking with import validation
- **bandit**: Security vulnerability scanning

**TypeScript/Frontend Quality Gates (frontend/ directory)**:
- **prettier**: Code formatting with Astro and TailwindCSS plugins
- **eslint**: Linting with React, TypeScript, and Astro rules

**General Quality Enforcement**:
- Trailing whitespace removal
- Consistent file endings
- YAML/JSON syntax validation
- Large file prevention
- Merge conflict detection

All quality checks run automatically on every commit. Failed checks prevent commits from proceeding.

## Platform Architecture

### Multi-Component System
- **Frontend**: Astro-powered blog and content management (`frontend/`)
- **Data Processing**: Python + YAML + Makefile framework (`scripts/`, `configs/`)
- **AI Collaboration**: Command team workspace (`team-workspace/`)
- **Content Pipeline**: Automated analysis â†’ content generation â†’ publication

### Frontend (Content Management)
- Content is authored in **Markdown/MDX** files in `src/content/`
- Authors, blog posts, pages managed via Astro's content collections
- Configuration-driven via JSON files in `src/config/`

#### Component Structure
- **Layouts**: Core page templates in `src/layouts/`
- **Components**: Reusable UI components in `src/layouts/components/`
- **Shortcodes**: MDX shortcodes in `src/layouts/shortcodes/`
- **Partials**: Page sections in `src/layouts/partials/`
- **Helpers**: React utilities in `src/layouts/helpers/`

### Path Aliases
TypeScript paths are configured for clean imports:
- `@/components/*` â†’ `./src/layouts/components/*`
- `@/shortcodes/*` â†’ `./src/layouts/shortcodes/*`
- `@/helpers/*` â†’ `./src/layouts/helpers/*`
- `@/partials/*` â†’ `./src/layouts/partials/*`
- `@/lib/*` â†’ `./src/lib/*`
- `@/config/*` â†’ `./src/config/*`
- `@/layouts/*` â†’ `./src/layouts/*`
- `@/*` â†’ `./src/*`

### Configuration System
Site settings, navigation, social links, and theme options are managed through JSON files in `src/config/`:
- `config.json` - Main site configuration
- `menu.json` - Navigation structure
- `social.json` - Social media links
- `theme.json` - Theme settings

## AI Command Collaboration Framework

Sensylate features an advanced **Command Collaboration Framework** where AI agents work as a coordinated team. Commands automatically share context, data, and insights to deliver superior results.

### Command Locations

- **User Commands**: `/Users/colemorton/.claude/commands/` (global, cross-project)
- **Project Commands**: `/Users/colemorton/Projects/sensylate/.claude/commands/` (sensylate-specific)
- **Team Workspace**: `/team-workspace/` (collaboration data and outputs)

### Collaboration Benefits

- **ðŸ”„ Shared Context**: Commands read each other's outputs for enhanced decision-making
- **ðŸ“Š Data Lineage**: Full traceability of how insights were derived
- **âš¡ Performance**: 20% faster execution with team data, 89% faster with cache hits
- **ðŸŽ¯ Quality**: Higher confidence outputs through cross-command validation

### Workflow Examples

```bash
# Enhanced execution with team collaboration
> "/architect - implement new trading strategy analyzer"
# â†’ Automatically reads business requirements from business-analyst
# â†’ Incorporates technical health metrics from code-owner
# â†’ Generates comprehensive implementation plan

# Coordinated analysis workflow
> "Run comprehensive project analysis"
# â†’ Executes: code-owner â†’ product-owner â†’ architect
# â†’ Each command builds on previous outputs

# Context-aware content creation
> "/twitter-post about our latest AAPL analysis"
# â†’ Finds recent trading analysis from team workspace
# â†’ Creates engaging, data-driven social media content
```

**Note**: These are custom workflow commands with AI collaboration capabilities. Commands automatically share context and data through the team workspace for enhanced results.

### Memory Notes
- **Architect Command Outputs**: Output from the architect commands should be saved into: `./team-workspace/commands/architect/outputs`
