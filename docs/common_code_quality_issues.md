### DO NOT MAKE THESE COMMN CODE QUALITY ISSUES:

- NO Technical Debt: Accumulated shortcuts or legacy logic, including historical artefacts and leftover reasoning, that hinder future development.

- NO Code Smell: Symptoms of poor design, such as narrative bloat and unused abstractions, that suggest deeper issues.

- NO Leaky Abstraction: Internal details are exposed, breaking encapsulation and increasing coupling.

- NO Narrative Bloat: Excessive or outdated commentary that clutters the code and distracts from its purpose.

- NO Historical Artefacts: Obsolete logic or naming left behind after refactors, creating confusion.

- NO Leaky Reasoning: Implementation reveals unnecessary rationale that should be encapsulated, violating information hiding.
