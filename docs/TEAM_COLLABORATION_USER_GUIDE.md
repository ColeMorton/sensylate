## 🎯 What is Team Collaboration?

### Before: Isolated Commands
```bash
> "/architect - implement user login"
# → Creates plan with only your request as context
# → No awareness of existing code health or business priorities
# → Starts from scratch every time

> "/product-owner - prioritize features"
# → Makes decisions without technical implementation context
# → Can't reference architect's previous work
# → Duplicates effort and analysis
```

### After: Intelligent Team Collaboration
```bash
> "/architect - implement user login"
# → Automatically finds code health assessment from code-owner
# → Incorporates business priorities from product-owner
# → References previous implementation patterns
# → Creates context-aware plan 20% faster

> "/product-owner - prioritize features"
# → Reads architect's implementation complexity assessments
# → References technical debt from code-owner
# → Makes informed business decisions
# → Builds on team knowledge
```

### 🎉 Key Benefits

- **⚡ 20% Faster Execution**: Commands reuse each other's work
- **🎯 Better Quality**: Decisions made with full context
- **🧠 Learning Team**: Knowledge accumulates over time
- **🔄 No Repetition**: Work builds on previous outputs
- **📊 Data-Driven**: All decisions backed by team insights

## 🚀 Quick Start (5 Minutes)

### Step 1: Check if Team Collaboration is Active

Look for the `team-workspace/` directory in your project:

```bash
ls team-workspace/
# Should show: commands/ shared/ sessions/
```

✅ **If you see these folders**: You're ready to go!
❌ **If not**: Contact your admin to enable team collaboration.

### Step 2: Try Your First Collaborative Command

Run any command as you normally would:

```bash
> "/architect - add search functionality to the website"
```

**Behind the scenes**, the system:
1. Checks for previous code analysis
2. Looks for business requirements
3. Finds relevant implementation patterns
4. Creates an enhanced plan

### Step 3: See the Collaboration in Action

Run a follow-up command:

```bash
> "/product-owner - estimate effort for the search feature"
```

Notice how this command automatically references the architect's implementation plan from Step 2!

### 🎊 Congratulations!

You're now using AI team collaboration. Each command builds on the work of others, creating smarter, faster, and more comprehensive results.

> "/code-owner - assess review implementation impact"  # 35s, isolated analysis
```
**Total**: 120 seconds, disconnected outputs

**Team Collaboration Approach**:
```bash
> "/code-owner - analyze current product data structure"    # 35s
> "/architect - add product reviews with rating system"     # 30s (faster with context)
> "/product-owner - create rollout strategy for reviews"    # 25s (informed by implementation)
```
**Total**: 90 seconds (25% faster), integrated strategy

**Result Comparison**:
- **Before**: Generic review system, unclear priorities, separate concerns
- **After**: Review system optimized for existing data structure, prioritized by implementation complexity, integrated rollout plan

### Example 2: Technical Debt Management

**User Request**: "Help prioritize technical debt"

**Team Collaboration Workflow**:
```bash
> "/code-owner - comprehensive technical debt assessment"
# → Identifies: Authentication module (High), Caching layer (Medium), UI components (Low)

> "/product-owner - prioritize technical debt by business impact"
# → Reads technical assessment automatically
# → Result: "Authentication affects user security (High Priority), Caching impacts performance revenue (Medium), UI is cosmetic (Low)"

> "/architect - create technical debt reduction roadmap"
# → Uses both technical assessment and business priorities
# → Result: 3-phase plan with specific timelines and resource requirements
```

**Outcome**: Data-driven technical debt roadmap that balances technical needs with business priorities.

## 🔧 Troubleshooting

### Common Issues and Solutions

#### Issue: "Commands aren't finding each other's outputs"

**Symptoms**:
- Commands seem to run in isolation
- No performance improvements
- Outputs don't reference team context

**Solutions**:
1. **Check workspace structure**:
   ```bash
   ls team-workspace/commands/
   # Should show folders for your commands
   ```

2. **Verify recent command outputs**:
   ```bash
   ls team-workspace/commands/*/outputs/
   # Should show recent .md files
   ```

3. **Run commands in sequence**:
   ```bash
   > "/code-owner - analyze project health"
   # Wait for completion, then...
   > "/architect - create improvement plan"
   ```

#### Issue: "Performance isn't improving"

**Symptoms**:
- Commands take the same time as before
- No cache benefits mentioned

**Possible Causes**:
- **New project**: No team data accumulated yet
- **Different command types**: Commands need related outputs to collaborate
- **Cache cleared**: Previous optimization data was removed

**Solutions**:
1. **Build team knowledge**:
   ```bash
   # Run foundational commands first
   > "/code-owner - comprehensive project analysis"
   > "/product-owner - create feature prioritization"
   ```

2. **Use related commands**:
   ```bash
   # These work well together
   > "/architect - implement feature X"
   > "/product-owner - estimate effort for feature X"
   ```

#### Issue: "Outputs seem generic"

**Symptoms**:
- Outputs don't seem enhanced
- No mention of team context
- Same quality as isolated commands

**Solutions**:
1. **Check command compatibility**:
   - Use commands that are designed to work together
   - Architect, product-owner, and code-owner collaborate well

2. **Provide specific context**:
   ```bash
   # Instead of:
   > "/architect - improve the code"

   # Try:
   > "/architect - refactor authentication based on code health assessment"
   ```

3. **Build context gradually**:
   ```bash
   # Run analysis first
   > "/code-owner - analyze authentication module"
   # Then use that context
   > "/architect - refactor authentication for better security"
   ```

## ❓ FAQ

### General Questions

**Q: How do I know if team collaboration is working?**

A: Look for these indicators:
- Commands mention "collaboration context" or "team data" in outputs
- Performance improvements noted (e.g., "20% faster due to team optimization")
- Outputs reference other commands' work (e.g., "Based on code-owner assessment...")
- Quality scores of 0.8+ with multiple data sources

**Q: Do I need to change how I use commands?**

A: No! Use commands exactly as before. The collaboration happens automatically behind the scenes. The only difference is that your commands will be smarter and faster.

**Q: What if I want to run a command in isolation?**

A: Currently, all commands automatically use team collaboration when available. This ensures the best possible results. If you need isolated execution for testing, contact your admin.

**Q: How long does it take to see collaboration benefits?**

A:
- **Immediate**: Commands start sharing data right away
- **1-2 commands**: You'll see basic collaboration
- **5+ commands**: Full collaboration benefits with performance improvements
- **Ongoing**: Team knowledge continues to improve results over time

### Technical Questions

**Q: Where is my team data stored?**

A: All team data is stored locally in your project's `team-workspace/` directory. Nothing is shared outside your project.

**Q: How much space does team collaboration use?**

A: Minimal. Command outputs are small text files (typically 1-10KB each). A full project might use 1-5MB for team collaboration data.

**Q: Can I see what data commands are sharing?**

A: Yes! Check these locations:
- `team-workspace/commands/[command]/outputs/` - Individual command outputs
- `team-workspace/shared/team-knowledge.yaml` - Accumulated team insights
- `team-workspace/sessions/` - Detailed execution logs

**Q: What happens if team data gets corrupted?**

A: The system is designed to be resilient:
- Commands gracefully degrade to isolated mode
- Corrupted data is detected and ignored
- The system continues to function normally
- New team data accumulates to replace any issues

### Workflow Questions

**Q: Which commands work best together?**

A: These combinations are highly effective:
- **code-owner → architect**: Technical analysis → Implementation planning
- **code-owner → product-owner**: Technical health → Business prioritization
- **architect → product-owner**: Implementation complexity → Resource planning
- **[any analysis] → twitter-post**: Data insights → Content creation

**Q: Should I run commands in a specific order?**

A: While commands work in any order, these patterns are most effective:
1. **Analysis first**: code-owner, business-analyst
2. **Strategy second**: product-owner, architect
3. **Action third**: implementation, content creation

**Q: How do I create the best workflow for my project?**

A:
1. **Start with assessment**: Run code-owner or business-analyst first
2. **Build understanding**: Use architect or product-owner with the assessment context
3. **Take action**: Use implementation or content commands with full context
4. **Iterate**: Repeat the cycle to build team knowledge

### Troubleshooting Questions

**Q: My commands are slower than before. Why?**

A: This can happen if:
- **First run with collaboration**: Initial setup takes slightly longer
- **Large team workspace**: Rare, but scanning lots of data can add overhead
- **System issues**: Contact support if consistently slow

**Q: Commands aren't mentioning team collaboration. Is it working?**

A: Check these things:
1. Look for `team-workspace/` directory in your project
2. Verify command outputs exist: `ls team-workspace/commands/*/outputs/`
3. Try running related commands in sequence
4. Contact support if still not working

**Q: I accidentally deleted team-workspace data. What now?**

A: No problem!
- Commands will start working in isolated mode immediately
- Team collaboration will begin rebuilding as you run more commands
- You won't lose any functionality, just the accumulated optimization benefits
- The system will be back to full collaboration within a few command executions
