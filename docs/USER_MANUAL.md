## üöÄ Getting Started

### System Requirements

- **Node.js**: 18+ for frontend development
- **Python**: 3.9+ for data processing
- **Git**: For version control and collaboration
- **Claude Code**: For AI command collaboration

### Initial Setup

1. **Clone and Install**:
   ```bash
   git clone [repository-url]
   cd sensylate

   # Frontend setup
   cd frontend/
   yarn install

   # Python setup (from root)
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   pip install -r requirements-dev.txt
   ```

2. **Environment Configuration**:
   ```bash
   # Copy environment template
   cp .env.example .env

   # Edit with your settings
   # Configure API keys and database connections
   ```

3. **Verify Installation**:
   ```bash
   # Test frontend
   cd frontend/
   yarn test

   # Test Python pipeline
   make test

   # Test collaboration framework
   make test-collaboration
   ```

### First Run

1. **Start Development Environment**:
   ```bash
   cd frontend/
   yarn dev
   ```

2. **Run Your First Analysis**:
   ```bash
   make dev-pipeline
   ```

3. **Try AI Collaboration**:
   ```bash
   > "/code-owner - analyze project health"
   ```

## ü§ù Team Collaboration Guide

> **‚≠ê NEW FEATURE**: Your AI commands now work as an intelligent team, sharing data and building on each other's work.

### What is Team Collaboration?

Instead of isolated command execution, your AI commands now:
- **Share Context**: Commands read each other's outputs
- **Build Knowledge**: Insights accumulate over time
- **Optimize Performance**: 20% faster execution with team data
- **Improve Quality**: Decisions informed by multiple perspectives

### Quick Start (2 Minutes)

1. **Check if Active**:
   ```bash
   ls team-workspace/
   # Should show: commands/ shared/ sessions/
   ```

2. **Try Collaborative Commands**:
   ```bash
   > "/code-owner - analyze current project health"
   > "/architect - create improvement plan based on health assessment"
   ```

3. **See the Magic**: Notice how the architect automatically uses the code-owner's assessment!

### Best Workflow Patterns

#### Complete Project Analysis
```bash
> "Run comprehensive project analysis"
# Automatically executes: code-owner ‚Üí product-owner ‚Üí architect
# Each builds on the previous output
```

#### Feature Development
```bash
> "/code-owner - analyze authentication module"         # Technical assessment
> "/architect - refactor auth for better security"      # Uses assessment for context
> "/product-owner - estimate effort for auth refactor"  # Uses implementation plan
```

#### Content Creation
```bash
> "/architect - summarize recent improvements"          # Find latest work
> "/twitter-post - create content about improvements"   # Auto-uses architect summary
```

### Available AI Team Members

> **Command Categories**:
> - **Core Product**: User-facing AI capabilities that ARE the product
> - **Infrastructure**: Development tools that ENABLE the product

| Command | Role | Best For |
|---------|------|----------|
| `/twitter-post` | Content Creation | Social media content optimization |
| `/twitter-post-strategy` | Financial Content | Trading/financial social media content |

## üìä Trading Analysis

### Data Processing Pipeline

Sensylate provides a complete trading analysis framework:

#### 1. Data Extraction
```bash
# Extract market data for specific symbols
make extract-data ENV=prod

# Quick development extraction
make quick-extract
```

**What it does**: Downloads market data, applies technical indicators, validates data quality.

#### 2. Feature Engineering
```bash
# Process extracted data
make process-data

# Quick processing for development
make quick-process
```

**What it does**: Generates technical indicators, calculates features, prepares data for analysis.

#### 3. Strategy Development
```bash
# Train trading models
make train-model

# Full pipeline (extract ‚Üí process ‚Üí train)
make full-pipeline
```

**What it does**: Develops trading strategies, backtests performance, generates model files.

#### 4. Report Generation
```bash
# Create analysis reports
make generate-report

# Environment-specific
make prod-pipeline
```

**What it does**: Creates comprehensive analysis reports with interactive Plotly visualizations, multi-format dashboard exports, and performance summaries.

### Configuration Files

All trading analysis is configuration-driven:

#### Data Sources (`config/pipelines/data_extraction.yaml`)
```yaml
symbols: ["AAPL", "GOOGL", "TSLA"]
timeframe: "1d"
indicators: ["SMA", "EMA", "RSI", "MACD"]
```

#### Strategy Parameters (`config/pipelines/model_training.yaml`)
```yaml
strategy_type: "momentum"
lookback_period: 20
risk_tolerance: 0.02
```

#### Environment Settings (`config/environments/`)
- `dev.yaml` - Development settings
- `staging.yaml` - Testing environment
- `prod.yaml` - Production parameters

### Output Structure

All analysis outputs are organized in `outputs/`:
```
outputs/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ reports/           # Analysis reports (HTML, PDF, Markdown)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ visualizations/    # Interactive Plotly charts (PNG, PDF, SVG, HTML)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ dashboards/        # Performance dashboards with multi-format export
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ frontend_configs/  # JSON configurations for React integration
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ exports/          # Data exports (CSV, JSON, Parquet)
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ logs/            # Execution logs
```

### AI-Enhanced Analysis

Use AI commands to enhance your trading analysis:

```bash
# Analyze strategy performance
> "/architect - analyze the momentum strategy backtest results"

# Create social content about performance
> "/twitter-post-strategy - post about our AAPL analysis results"

# Prioritize strategy improvements
> "/product-owner - prioritize trading strategy enhancements"
```

## üîß Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

#### Frontend Issues

**Issue**: Development server won't start
```bash
# Check Node.js version
node --version  # Should be 18+

# Clear cache and reinstall
rm -rf node_modules yarn.lock
yarn install

# Check for port conflicts
lsof -i :4321
```

**Issue**: Build failures
```bash
# Check TypeScript errors
yarn check

# Run linting
yarn lint

# Check configuration
yarn generate-json
```

#### Trading Analysis Issues

**Issue**: Data extraction fails
```bash
# Check API credentials
cat .env | grep API

# Validate configuration
make validate-configs

# Check network connectivity
ping api.tradingview.com
```

**Issue**: Pipeline execution errors
```bash
# Check Python environment
python --version  # Should be 3.9+
pip list | grep pandas

# Run individual steps
make extract-data
make process-data
make train-model
```

#### Team Collaboration Issues

**Issue**: Commands not collaborating
```bash
# Check workspace structure
ls team-workspace/
ls team-workspace/commands/*/outputs/

# Verify recent activity
tail team-workspace/sessions/*/collaboration-engine.log

# Test with simple workflow
> "/code-owner - quick project health check"
> "/architect - suggest one improvement"
```

**Issue**: Performance not improving
```bash
# Check team knowledge accumulation
cat team-workspace/shared/team-knowledge.yaml

# Verify command outputs exist
find team-workspace/commands -name "*.md" -mtime -1

# Clear cache if needed
rm -rf team-workspace/commands/*/cache/*
```

### Performance Optimization

#### Frontend Performance
```bash
# Optimize images
yarn build --analyze

# Check bundle size
yarn build && ls -la dist/

# Lighthouse audit
yarn preview  # Then run Lighthouse on localhost:4321
```

#### Trading Analysis Performance
```bash
# Parallel execution
make -j4 full-pipeline

# Profile execution
time make extract-data

# Optimize data processing
# Edit config/pipelines/feature_engineering.yaml to reduce indicators
```

#### Team Collaboration Performance
```bash
# Check cache effectiveness
grep "cache hit" team-workspace/sessions/*/collaboration-engine.log

# Monitor session performance
grep "execution_time" team-workspace/commands/*/outputs/.*.command-meta.yaml
```

### Getting Help

#### Log Files
- **Frontend**: Browser developer tools console
- **Trading Analysis**: `outputs/logs/`
- **Team Collaboration**: `team-workspace/sessions/`

#### Debug Information
```bash
# System information
make check-env-vars
yarn check
