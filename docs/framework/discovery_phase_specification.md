# Discovery Phase Framework Specification

**Version**: 1.0
**DASV Framework**: Phase 1 - Discovery
**Author**: Sensylate Framework Architecture
**Date**: 2025-07-26

## Executive Summary

The Discovery Phase Framework defines the universal architecture, output structures, and quality standards that govern all discovery implementations in the DASV (Discover → Analyze → Synthesize → Validate) framework. This specification establishes the core patterns that ensure institutional-grade data collection and validation across all analysis types while maintaining clear boundaries between framework concerns and domain-specific specializations.

## 1. Framework Architecture Overview

### 1.1 Discovery Phase Positioning

The Discovery Phase serves as **Phase 1** of the DASV framework, responsible for:

- **Primary Purpose**: Systematic collection and initial structuring of high-quality data required for comprehensive analysis
- **Quality Mandate**: Institutional-grade data validation with confidence scoring targeting >90%
- **Integration Role**: Foundation layer that provides validated data packages for subsequent analysis phases
- **Framework Position**: Source phase with no upstream dependencies, feeds all downstream phases

### 1.2 Core Discovery Objectives

All discovery implementations must achieve:

1. **Multi-Source Data Collection**: Utilize production CLI services for comprehensive data gathering
2. **Cross-Validation**: Implement multi-source validation with confidence scoring
3. **Quality Assurance**: Maintain institutional-grade quality standards (>90% confidence)
4. **Structured Output**: Generate standardized JSON outputs following framework schemas
5. **Phase Readiness**: Ensure data packages meet requirements for subsequent analysis phases

### 1.3 Framework vs Specialization Boundaries

**Framework Concerns** (Universal across all discovery types):
- CLI integration architecture and service health monitoring
- Multi-source price validation and confidence scoring
- Quality assessment frameworks and thresholds
- Output structure templates and metadata standards
- Economic context integration patterns
- Validation and enhancement protocols

**Specialization Concerns** (Domain-specific implementations):
- Business-specific data collection requirements
- Domain-specific quality metrics and KPIs
- Specialized data processing and calculations
- Context-specific validation rules
- Custom output sections and fields

## 2. Universal Output Structure Framework

### 2.1 Core Required Sections

All discovery phase outputs MUST include these framework-mandated sections:

```json
{
  "metadata": { /* Framework execution metadata */ },
  "cli_comprehensive_analysis": { /* Multi-source integration summary */ },
  "cli_market_context": { /* Economic indicators and market environment */ },
  "cli_service_validation": { /* Service health and operational status */ },
  "cli_data_quality": { /* Overall data quality assessment */ },
  "cli_insights": { /* Framework-level observations and insights */ },
  "data_quality_assessment": { /* Comprehensive quality validation */ }
}
```

### 2.2 Framework Metadata Structure

**Required Fields**:
```json
{
  "metadata": {
    "command_name": "cli_enhanced_{specialization}_discover",
    "execution_timestamp": "ISO_8601_format",
    "framework_phase": "cli_enhanced_discover_7_source",
    "data_collection_methodology": "production_cli_services_unified_access",
    "cli_services_utilized": ["array_of_successfully_utilized_services"],
    "api_keys_configured": "production_keys_from_config/financial_services.yaml"
  }
}
```

**Field Specifications**:
- `command_name`: Must follow pattern `cli_enhanced_{specialization}_discover`
- `execution_timestamp`: ISO 8601 with microsecond precision
- `framework_phase`: Must be `cli_enhanced_discover_7_source`
- `cli_services_utilized`: Dynamic array tracking only successful service responses
- `api_keys_configured`: Reference to secure configuration (never include actual keys)

### 2.3 Framework Extension Points

Specializations may extend the framework structure by:

1. **Adding Specialized Sections**: Domain-specific data sections alongside framework sections
2. **Extending Existing Sections**: Adding fields to framework sections (with `additionalProperties: true`)
3. **Custom Validation Rules**: Additional validation beyond framework minimums
4. **Enhanced Quality Metrics**: Specialized quality assessments supplementing framework standards

## 3. CLI Integration Framework

### 3.1 Production CLI Services Architecture

**7-Source Integration Standard**:
All discovery implementations utilize these production CLI services:

1. **Yahoo Finance CLI** - Core market data, financial statements, price validation
2. **Alpha Vantage CLI** - Real-time quotes, sentiment analysis, technical indicators
3. **FMP CLI** - Advanced financials, company intelligence, insider trading data
4. **SEC EDGAR CLI** - Regulatory filings, compliance data, SEC financial statements
5. **FRED Economic CLI** - Federal Reserve indicators, macroeconomic data
6. **CoinGecko CLI** - Cryptocurrency sentiment, risk appetite analysis
7. **IMF Data CLI** - Global economic indicators, country risk assessment

### 3.2 Multi-Source Price Validation

**Framework Standard**: All discovery implementations must implement cross-source price validation:

```json
{
  "price_validation": {
    "yahoo_finance_price": "decimal_value",
    "alpha_vantage_price": "decimal_value",
    "fmp_price": "decimal_value",
    "price_consistency": "boolean_must_be_true",
    "confidence_score": "0.0-1.0_targeting_1.000"
  }
}
```

**Validation Requirements**:
- Minimum 3 price sources for institutional-grade validation
- Price consistency must be `true` for quality certification
- Confidence score targeting 1.000 for perfect consistency
- <2% variance threshold for acceptable price differences

### 3.3 Service Health Monitoring

**Framework Standard**:
```json
{
  "cli_service_validation": {
    "service_health": "operational_degraded_offline",
    "health_score": "0.0-1.0_minimum_0.8",
    "services_operational": "integer_minimum_5",
    "services_healthy": "boolean_must_be_true"
  }
}
```

**Monitoring Requirements**:
- Health score >0.8 required for institutional certification
- Minimum 5 services operational for comprehensive analysis
- `services_healthy` must be `true` for framework compliance
- Real-time service availability validation before data collection

### 3.4 Dynamic Service Tracking

**Implementation Pattern**:
- `cli_services_utilized` tracks only services that successfully provided data
- Services excluded if they fail health checks or data collection
- Dynamic array prevents static assumptions about service availability
- Enables graceful degradation while maintaining quality standards
