## Quality Standards Framework

### Institutional Quality Tiers
- **Institutional Excellence** (‚â•9.5): Premium grade publication-ready
- **Institutional Standard** (‚â•9.0): Professional analysis baseline  
- **Professional Standard** (‚â•8.0): Internal analysis minimum
- **Insufficient** (<8.0): Rejected, requires rework

### Universal Quality Thresholds
```yaml
institutional_minimum:
  overall_confidence: "‚â• 0.90"
  data_completeness: "‚â• 0.85" 
  service_health: "‚â• 0.80"
  source_reliability: "‚â• 0.85"
```

### Fail-Fast Architecture
- Quality thresholds enforced at phase transitions
- Immediate exception throwing prevents degraded outputs
- Meaningful error messages for proper issue resolution
