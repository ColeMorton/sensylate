## Content Optimization Framework

### Engagement Mechanics

1. **Lead with Numbers**: Specific percentages, dollar amounts, ratios
2. **Use Emojis Strategically**: 1-2 relevant emojis max for visual appeal
3. **Create Curiosity Gaps**: Tease insights before revealing
4. **Include Contrarian Elements**: Challenge conventional wisdom
5. **End with Clear Stakes**: What happens if thesis plays out

### Writing Style Requirements

- **Plain Language**: No jargon without explanation
- **Active Voice**: "Tesla dominates" not "Tesla is dominated by"
- **Specific Claims**: "$45/share impact" not "significant impact"
- **Present Tense**: Create immediacy and urgency
- **Confident Tone**: Back analysis with conviction scores

### Character Count Optimization

- **Target Length**: 280 characters per tweet (can thread if needed)
- **Tweet 1**: Hook + core insight
- **Tweet 2** (if needed): Supporting data
- **Tweet 3** (if needed): Risk/timeline/action

## Content Angle Selection Framework

### Template Selection Guidelines

**A. Valuation Angle**
- Current price vs fair value disconnect
- Multiple method convergence/divergence
- Scenario analysis outcomes

**B. Catalyst Angle**
- Upcoming events with quantified impact
- Probability-weighted opportunity sizing
- Timeline and execution risk assessment

**C. Competitive Moat Angle**
- Sustainable advantages with evidence
- Market position strengthening/weakening
- Innovation or disruption resistance

**D. Contrarian Angle**
- Market misunderstanding correction
- Hidden value discovery
- Risk perception vs reality

**E. Financial Health Angle**
- Balance sheet strength/weakness
- Cash flow generation power
- Capital allocation track record

## Mandatory Compliance Framework

### Investment Disclaimer Requirements (NON-NEGOTIABLE)

  - `‚ö†Ô∏è Not financial advice. Investments carry risk of loss.`
  - `‚ö†Ô∏è Not financial advice. Stock investments carry risk of loss.`

**ENFORCEMENT**: Templates automatically include disclaimer text. Content generation WILL FAIL validation if disclaimer is missing or modified.

**REGULATORY COMPLIANCE**:
- No investment advice language without disclaimers

### Market Data Requirements

**MANDATORY: Real-Time Price Integration**

- Access current_price from fundamental_metrics.current_price in standardized format
- Ensures Twitter content reflects real-time market conditions via MCP data_quality.timestamp

**Workflow Reminder**:
‚ö†Ô∏è **CRITICAL FIRST STEP**: Before processing any analysis, ALWAYS get current stock price using the standardized Yahoo Finance MCP server.

```
Use: MCP Tool yahoo-finance/get_stock_fundamentals(ticker)
Extract: fundamental_metrics.current_price, trading_metrics.volume, fundamental_metrics.market_cap
Validate data freshness via data_quality.timestamp and cache_status
```

**Never use the price from the fundamental analysis file - it may be outdated. Always use real-time market data from the Yahoo Finance MCP server with standardized data quality indicators.**
